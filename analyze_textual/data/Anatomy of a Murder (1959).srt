2
00:02:27,300 --> 00:02:30,845
Your pal just drove into town,
Mr. McCarthy.

3
00:02:32,013 --> 00:02:33,973
I'll have one more, Toybo.

4
00:02:35,392 --> 00:02:38,311
I'm afraid I'll have to pay
my bar bill tomorrow.

5
00:02:38,395 --> 00:02:42,148
- You're good with me, Mr. McCarthy.
- Thank you, Toybo.

6
00:02:47,779 --> 00:02:51,116
- Good night, Toybo.
- Good night, Mr. McCarthy.

7
00:04:55,031 --> 00:04:56,282
<i>Operator.</i>

8
00:04:57,575 --> 00:04:59,827
Operator, I want...

9
00:04:59,910 --> 00:05:03,873
...489 Thunder Bay.
I want to speak to Mrs. Manion.

10
00:05:04,665 --> 00:05:06,542
M-A-N-I-O-N.

11
00:05:07,251 --> 00:05:10,588
This is Paul Biegler speaking.
Iron City 700.

12
00:05:23,184 --> 00:05:26,270
<i>- Will they know when she'll be there?
- No, they don't.</i>

13
00:05:26,353 --> 00:05:29,899
I see. You just leave a message.
Tell her to call this number.

14
00:05:34,779 --> 00:05:37,907
- What do you say there, Counsellor?
- Save your money.

15
00:05:40,785 --> 00:05:45,080
- What's in the brown paper bag?
- It might be a cabbage head.

16
00:05:46,624 --> 00:05:47,917
But it wouldn't be.

17
00:05:48,417 --> 00:05:50,711
You're a very suspicious man.

18
00:05:52,713 --> 00:05:53,964
True.

19
00:05:55,007 --> 00:05:57,092
I'm everlastingly suspicious of...

20
00:05:57,218 --> 00:05:59,929
...andlor fascinated by...

21
00:06:00,554 --> 00:06:02,848
...the contents of brown paper bags.

22
00:06:03,807 --> 00:06:07,019
- Can I sneak a peek?
- You do that, Counsellor.

23
00:06:09,438 --> 00:06:10,689
You do that.

24
00:06:11,857 --> 00:06:15,486
After you sneak a peek,
why, you uncork whatever you find.

25
00:06:23,202 --> 00:06:24,244
Shall I pour?

26
00:06:24,370 --> 00:06:26,872
- Your privilege.
- My pleasure, sir.

27
00:06:37,466 --> 00:06:42,471
You fought this soldier by yourself.
You've been drinking alone, Pauly.

28
00:06:43,263 --> 00:06:45,015
I don't like that.

29
00:06:45,182 --> 00:06:48,394
Drop the stone, Counsellor.
You live in a glass house.

30
00:06:49,019 --> 00:06:53,190
My windows were busted a long time ago,
so I can say as I please.

31
00:06:55,943 --> 00:06:59,488
- Have an Italian cigar?
- No, thanks.

32
00:07:00,072 --> 00:07:03,826
Those stinkweeds
are another sign of your decadence.

33
00:07:07,538 --> 00:07:09,081
Pauly, it's a fact.

34
00:07:09,206 --> 00:07:12,751
Since Mitch Lodwick beat you out
of the office of public prosecutor...

35
00:07:12,835 --> 00:07:18,048
...you haven't been worth salt for peanuts.
Not that I don't understand how you feel.

36
00:07:19,591 --> 00:07:23,762
A man who gets beat out of an office
he's held for a long time...

37
00:07:24,179 --> 00:07:28,934
...feels his community has deserted him.
The finger of scorn is pointed at him.

38
00:07:29,017 --> 00:07:32,020
None but the lonely hearts
shall know my anguish.

39
00:07:32,104 --> 00:07:35,023
Pauly, you are a good lawyer.
You ought to make like one.

40
00:07:35,148 --> 00:07:37,234
Be here ready for clients, not fishing...

41
00:07:37,359 --> 00:07:39,820
...and playing that rooty-tooty jazz.

42
00:07:39,903 --> 00:07:41,947
I'm making a living.

43
00:07:42,239 --> 00:07:47,202
I run a few abstracts and divorce Jane Doe
from John Doe every once in a while.

44
00:07:47,369 --> 00:07:51,415
Threaten a few deadbeats.
And in the evening I sit around...

45
00:07:51,498 --> 00:07:56,294
...and drink bourbon whiskey and read law
with Parnell Emmitt McCarthy.

46
00:07:56,878 --> 00:07:59,172
One of the world's great men.

47
00:07:59,339 --> 00:08:04,553
That was a kind word, Pauly.
You know, I might have been.

48
00:08:05,971 --> 00:08:10,308
That's one of the reasons I hate to see
your talent pushed aside by lesser men.

49
00:08:10,434 --> 00:08:14,312
I look at you and see myself years ago,
with the same love for the smell...

50
00:08:14,396 --> 00:08:18,150
...of the old brown books in a dusty office.

51
00:08:20,193 --> 00:08:23,321
Here's a rose, a lily...

52
00:08:23,864 --> 00:08:25,991
...a sweet lupine.

53
00:08:26,116 --> 00:08:29,452
<i>The United States Supreme Court Reports.</i>

54
00:08:32,289 --> 00:08:34,583
What shall we read this evening,
Counsellor?

55
00:08:34,958 --> 00:08:37,961
How about a little Chief Justice Holmes?

56
00:08:41,673 --> 00:08:46,219
Restrain Chief Justice Holmes for a minute.
I might have a client. Waiting for a call.

57
00:08:46,344 --> 00:08:48,305
<i>- Hello?
- Mr. Biegler?</i>

58
00:08:48,430 --> 00:08:52,100
This is Paul Biegler speaking.
Hello, Mrs. Manion?

59
00:08:52,183 --> 00:08:54,060
<i>- What?
- Mr. Biegler?</i>

60
00:08:54,185 --> 00:08:56,605
I'm sorry I missed you.
Did you get my message?

61
00:08:56,688 --> 00:08:58,023
Who? What is that name?

62
00:08:58,106 --> 00:09:01,443
Just a minute, please.
We seem to have a bad connection.

63
00:09:02,110 --> 00:09:05,322
It's a woman named Manion.
Maida took a message from her.

64
00:09:05,447 --> 00:09:09,117
In Thunder Bay? If she wants you
to represent her husband, say yes.

65
00:09:09,242 --> 00:09:13,038
- I don't know what it's all about.
- Pretend you do and say yes.

66
00:09:13,121 --> 00:09:14,414
<i>- Hello?
- Mr. Biegler?</i>

67
00:09:14,497 --> 00:09:17,459
This is much better now.
Yes, I can hear you fine.

68
00:09:17,834 --> 00:09:20,420
I waited for your call all afternoon.

69
00:09:20,503 --> 00:09:22,964
<i>Yes, well, I just got in a few moments ago.</i>

70
00:09:23,506 --> 00:09:25,842
You've read about my husband?
Muffy, please.

71
00:09:26,134 --> 00:09:27,177
Yes.

72
00:09:27,510 --> 00:09:31,055
<i>Mr. Biegler,
have you read about my husband?</i>

73
00:09:33,308 --> 00:09:35,310
Yes, I have. A little.

74
00:09:35,602 --> 00:09:37,187
<i>Will you defend him?</i>

75
00:09:37,270 --> 00:09:39,731
I don't know.
I'd have to know more about it.

76
00:09:39,814 --> 00:09:40,982
<i>Will you talk to him?</i>

77
00:09:41,191 --> 00:09:44,110
He's in the county jail.
Will you see him in the morning?

78
00:09:44,194 --> 00:09:47,864
He's very anxious to see you.
You've been so highly recommended.

79
00:09:48,573 --> 00:09:49,824
I have?

80
00:09:49,991 --> 00:09:53,244
<i>Yes, someone told him about you.
Will you see him?</i>

81
00:09:53,328 --> 00:09:55,788
I suppose I could.
I'll see him tomorrow morning.

82
00:09:57,290 --> 00:10:00,335
<i>- Would you want me there, too?
- I think that would be fine.</i>

83
00:10:00,627 --> 00:10:03,171
Let's make it about 10:00.

84
00:10:04,088 --> 00:10:07,008
<i>- Thank you so much.
- You're quite welcome.</i>

85
00:10:07,842 --> 00:10:09,636
What's this all about?

86
00:10:09,719 --> 00:10:12,722
A man named Barney Quill
raped Mrs. Manion.

87
00:10:12,805 --> 00:10:14,933
Her husband is a lieutenant in the Army.

88
00:10:15,016 --> 00:10:17,977
There's a base in Thunder Bay,
gunnery or something.

89
00:10:18,102 --> 00:10:22,940
The lieutenant goes to Quill's place
and plugs Quill about five times...

90
00:10:23,066 --> 00:10:25,735
...which causes Quill
to die of lead poisoning.

91
00:10:25,818 --> 00:10:27,695
- When?
- A couple of nights ago.

92
00:10:27,779 --> 00:10:32,200
If you hadn't been out fishing in some
godforsaken place, you'd have known.

93
00:11:47,358 --> 00:11:48,567
Good morning, Maida.

94
00:11:48,693 --> 00:11:50,319
- There it is.
- What?

95
00:11:50,444 --> 00:11:53,447
The newspaper.
I thought maybe they didn't bring it.

96
00:11:53,531 --> 00:11:56,659
We haven't paid the bill.
Did you get my note?

97
00:11:56,951 --> 00:11:59,412
We may be in the case.
I'm reading up on it now...

98
00:11:59,495 --> 00:12:01,455
...before talking to Lt. Manion.

99
00:12:01,539 --> 00:12:03,290
Doesn't he ever go home?

100
00:12:03,374 --> 00:12:06,335
You mean Parnell?
We were up late last night.

101
00:12:06,419 --> 00:12:07,962
Is that a fact?

102
00:12:08,087 --> 00:12:11,674
I think maybe you'd better cancel
all my appointments for today.

103
00:12:11,799 --> 00:12:15,761
What appointments?
People think you've migrated to the woods.

104
00:12:17,138 --> 00:12:19,348
If this refrigerator gets more fish in it...

105
00:12:19,431 --> 00:12:22,560
...it'll swim upstream
and spawn all by itself.

106
00:12:24,562 --> 00:12:27,690
May I have your attention
for a moment, please?

107
00:12:28,691 --> 00:12:29,650
Yeah.

108
00:12:29,775 --> 00:12:33,946
I went over your cheque-book yesterday.
I can't pay me my salary.

109
00:12:34,280 --> 00:12:36,657
What happened to the fee
for the Walkers' divorce?

110
00:12:36,866 --> 00:12:39,785
Help salt a uranium mine or something?

111
00:12:40,202 --> 00:12:42,329
I bought a few bare necessities.

112
00:12:42,454 --> 00:12:46,625
Like a new outboard motor.
I wish I could be classed as a necessity.

113
00:12:47,334 --> 00:12:50,045
- Aren't you going to have any toast?
- No.

114
00:12:50,879 --> 00:12:54,258
I'll call you.
Let you know how things are going.

115
00:12:54,383 --> 00:12:56,969
Now, don't let him pay you off
in Purple Hearts.

116
00:12:57,052 --> 00:12:59,596
Those professional soldiers
never have a dime.

117
00:12:59,680 --> 00:13:02,016
I ought to know, I was married to one.

118
00:13:23,370 --> 00:13:25,247
Pardon me. Are you Mrs. Manion?

119
00:13:25,330 --> 00:13:27,207
- Hi.
- I'm Paul Biegler.

120
00:13:27,833 --> 00:13:29,918
- I'm Laura.
- How do you do?

121
00:13:30,878 --> 00:13:32,755
- This is Muff.
- Hello, Muff.

122
00:13:33,297 --> 00:13:35,382
The jail's right here.

123
00:13:38,177 --> 00:13:39,845
You're tall!

124
00:13:42,848 --> 00:13:45,559
- Hello, Pauly.
- Hi, Sulo.

125
00:13:45,851 --> 00:13:47,936
You wait here, Muffy.

126
00:13:52,900 --> 00:13:54,651
- Good to see you.
- How're you feeling?

127
00:13:54,735 --> 00:13:57,571
Fine. I guess you've come
for the soldier boy?

128
00:13:57,696 --> 00:14:00,490
Yes. Do you think we could talk
in the sheriff's office?

129
00:14:00,574 --> 00:14:03,493
Sure, I'll bring him down.

130
00:14:13,962 --> 00:14:17,090
Would you mind taking your glasses off,
Mrs. Manion?

131
00:14:19,676 --> 00:14:22,387
Gee-whiz. Barney Quill do that to you?

132
00:14:22,638 --> 00:14:25,766
More than that. You should see. All over.

133
00:14:27,934 --> 00:14:31,480
You can put them back on,
if it's more comfortable for you.

134
00:14:39,946 --> 00:14:42,574
This is Pauly Biegler.
This is the bucko, Pauly.

135
00:14:42,657 --> 00:14:44,034
- Lt. Manion?
- Hello, there.

136
00:14:44,159 --> 00:14:47,079
- Hi, Manny.
- Hello, Laura.

137
00:14:49,956 --> 00:14:54,211
I wonder if you could meet me
down at my office about 2:00 p.m.

138
00:14:54,377 --> 00:14:56,046
It's 305 West Barnham.

139
00:14:56,379 --> 00:14:57,923
- Of course.
- Fine.

140
00:14:58,507 --> 00:15:02,260
- Is there anything I can get you, hon?
- I'm all right, hon.

141
00:15:04,805 --> 00:15:06,348
Right in here.

142
00:15:19,778 --> 00:15:20,987
Wanted: The Big 10.

143
00:15:22,906 --> 00:15:28,119
They got the 10 best-dressed dames,
the 10 top teams, the 10 top tunes...

144
00:15:28,828 --> 00:15:30,664
...and now the 10 most-wanted.

145
00:15:30,747 --> 00:15:32,999
Don't knock it. That's the American dream.

146
00:15:33,124 --> 00:15:35,001
Those boys made the grade.

147
00:15:35,210 --> 00:15:39,839
You were the district attorney around here,
weren't you?

148
00:15:39,923 --> 00:15:41,800
Yes. Ten years.

149
00:15:42,384 --> 00:15:45,095
What's your experience
as a defence lawyer?

150
00:15:45,220 --> 00:15:46,388
Not very much.

151
00:15:46,513 --> 00:15:49,224
How do I know you can handle my case?

152
00:15:49,307 --> 00:15:52,852
I guess you don't know.
Shall we talk about it?

153
00:15:54,896 --> 00:15:56,398
I suppose so.

154
00:15:57,607 --> 00:15:59,651
Come on. Don't be so bored.

155
00:15:59,734 --> 00:16:03,446
You know, it might very well be
that no lawyer can "handle" your case...

156
00:16:03,530 --> 00:16:05,323
...if you mean getting off scot-free.

157
00:16:05,740 --> 00:16:08,993
You seem to be forgetting:
Barney Quill raped my wife.

158
00:16:09,077 --> 00:16:10,829
I have the unwritten law on my side.

159
00:16:11,329 --> 00:16:13,623
The unwritten law is a myth.

160
00:16:13,873 --> 00:16:16,668
There is no such thing
as the unwritten law.

161
00:16:16,793 --> 00:16:19,879
Anyone who commits murder
on the theory it does exist...

162
00:16:19,963 --> 00:16:23,133
...has bought himself room and board
in the state penitentiary.

163
00:16:23,216 --> 00:16:24,884
Maybe for life.

164
00:16:26,511 --> 00:16:31,724
With that in mind, perhaps we can proceed
with a few questions and answers that...

165
00:16:33,643 --> 00:16:35,311
Can I borrow your lighter?

166
00:16:38,439 --> 00:16:40,608
We can proceed with a few questions...

167
00:16:40,692 --> 00:16:44,028
...that might be of some help
in your defence.

168
00:16:45,947 --> 00:16:47,824
But probably won't be.

169
00:16:49,784 --> 00:16:51,869
That's a nice lighter.

170
00:16:56,833 --> 00:16:59,002
- How old are you?
- Twenty-eight.

171
00:16:59,085 --> 00:17:02,171
- How long have you been in the service?
- Since '50.

172
00:17:02,839 --> 00:17:05,174
- Have you seen any action?
- Korea.

173
00:17:05,258 --> 00:17:08,177
- Do you have any decorations?
- Plenty.

174
00:17:08,261 --> 00:17:11,389
- Is this your first marriage?
- No.

175
00:17:11,556 --> 00:17:13,182
You're not on the witness stand.

176
00:17:13,266 --> 00:17:17,437
You don't have to answer yes or no.
Just give me the matrimonial rundown.

177
00:17:17,770 --> 00:17:19,230
Is this necessary?

178
00:17:19,897 --> 00:17:21,774
I'll be the judge of that.

179
00:17:23,276 --> 00:17:26,612
My first wife divorced me.
Charged cruelty.

180
00:17:28,364 --> 00:17:31,701
Eating crackers in bed,
you know, the usual stuff.

181
00:17:32,076 --> 00:17:36,247
The truth was, she found another guy
when I was in Korea.

182
00:17:38,541 --> 00:17:44,380
I met Laura four years ago, in Georgia.
We were married right after her divorce.

183
00:17:44,797 --> 00:17:46,883
Did you know the husband?

184
00:17:47,425 --> 00:17:49,010
He was in my outfit down there.

185
00:17:49,093 --> 00:17:51,179
You mean you were buddies?

186
00:17:51,637 --> 00:17:54,974
I'll withdraw the question.
That's a little old-fashioned.

187
00:17:55,057 --> 00:17:59,020
Have there been any children
by or from any of these marriages?

188
00:17:59,186 --> 00:18:01,981
- No.
- Any present prospects?

189
00:18:02,064 --> 00:18:04,692
Not unless Barney Quill started something.

190
00:18:04,775 --> 00:18:07,028
What kind of a gun did you use on Quill?

191
00:18:07,111 --> 00:18:09,947
War souvenir. Luger.
The police have it now.

192
00:18:10,031 --> 00:18:13,075
I suppose you've read
the newspaper stories about your case?

193
00:18:13,200 --> 00:18:14,327
Some of them.

194
00:18:14,410 --> 00:18:17,121
- Are they substantially correct?
- Yes.

195
00:18:17,246 --> 00:18:20,583
And you didn't see Quill
rape and beat your wife?

196
00:18:20,875 --> 00:18:26,297
No. When she got back to the trailer,
she told me what had happened.

197
00:18:26,839 --> 00:18:29,842
How long was it
before you went to Quill's and killed him?

198
00:18:29,925 --> 00:18:31,802
I don't know exactly. Maybe an hour.

199
00:18:31,927 --> 00:18:33,304
That long?

200
00:18:34,388 --> 00:18:37,892
The newspapers say your wife volunteered
to take a lie-detector test.

201
00:18:37,975 --> 00:18:39,393
Know anything about this?

202
00:18:39,518 --> 00:18:41,353
Only what I read and what she told me.

203
00:18:41,437 --> 00:18:43,981
Do you know
how the lie-detector test turned out?

204
00:18:44,065 --> 00:18:46,400
- They didn't tell her.
- Yes, Sulo?

205
00:18:46,525 --> 00:18:50,488
Pauly, we got lunch served for the jail.
Do you want to eat with us?

206
00:18:51,280 --> 00:18:54,950
- Does your sister still cook for the jail?
- Sure, she cooks.

207
00:18:56,702 --> 00:19:01,582
You give her my compliments, Sulo.
I've got a luncheon date downtown.

208
00:19:01,665 --> 00:19:03,542
- Nice going...
- I'll be back after lunch.

209
00:19:05,127 --> 00:19:08,005
I'm sorry if I offended you a while ago.

210
00:19:08,506 --> 00:19:10,174
No, you're not.

211
00:19:11,425 --> 00:19:12,760
Come on, bucko.

212
00:19:16,931 --> 00:19:19,016
Pass the salt, Pauly.

213
00:19:21,352 --> 00:19:22,603
Thank you.

214
00:19:24,146 --> 00:19:27,149
Did you give the lieutenant
the well-known lecture?

215
00:19:27,274 --> 00:19:30,736
If you mean,
"Did I coach him into a phoney story?" No.

216
00:19:31,570 --> 00:19:36,784
Maybe you're too pure, Paul. Too pure
for the natural impurities of the law.

217
00:19:38,452 --> 00:19:42,498
Could be that you owe the lieutenant
a chance to find a defence.

218
00:19:42,623 --> 00:19:47,419
You might guide him, show him the way
and let him decide if he wants to take it.

219
00:19:47,503 --> 00:19:50,214
- Want some salt?
- No, I'm not ready.

220
00:19:50,297 --> 00:19:54,676
I'm not the right lawyer for this fellow.
He's insolent, hostile.

221
00:19:56,428 --> 00:19:59,515
You don't have to love him,
just defend him.

222
00:19:59,723 --> 00:20:02,643
What's the matter, don't you need a fee?

223
00:20:03,352 --> 00:20:06,730
You know something?
I think you might be a little bit afraid.

224
00:20:06,814 --> 00:20:10,567
- Afraid of what?
- That you might get licked.

225
00:20:13,946 --> 00:20:17,616
You know, there's only one thing
more devious than a Philadelphia lawyer...

226
00:20:17,699 --> 00:20:21,245
...and that's an Irish lawyer. Pass the salt.

227
00:20:24,414 --> 00:20:26,917
Put it down!

228
00:20:33,298 --> 00:20:36,843
- Hello, there.
- I usually answer to the name Paul.

229
00:20:37,594 --> 00:20:39,596
Are we gonna have some more jokes?

230
00:20:39,680 --> 00:20:42,015
Not unless you want to be the comic.

231
00:20:43,267 --> 00:20:46,353
- I brought you some cigarettes.
- Thanks.

232
00:20:46,436 --> 00:20:47,938
- Peace?
- Sure.

233
00:20:48,021 --> 00:20:49,898
Fine. Now, Lieutenant...

234
00:20:50,524 --> 00:20:53,402
...there are four ways I can defend murder.

235
00:20:54,069 --> 00:20:57,531
Number 1: It wasn't murder.
It was suicide or accidental.

236
00:20:57,614 --> 00:21:01,076
Number 2: You didn't do it.
Number 3: You were legally justified.

237
00:21:01,159 --> 00:21:03,286
Like protecting your home or self-defence.

238
00:21:03,370 --> 00:21:05,872
Number 4: The killing was excusable.

239
00:21:06,999 --> 00:21:09,710
Where do I fit into this rosy picture?

240
00:21:09,793 --> 00:21:14,047
I'll tell you where you don't fit.
You don't fit in any of the first three.

241
00:21:14,131 --> 00:21:18,009
Why wouldn't I be legally justified
in killing the man who raped my wife?

242
00:21:18,135 --> 00:21:19,803
The time element.

243
00:21:19,886 --> 00:21:23,932
If you'd caught him in the act, the shooting
might be justified. But you didn't.

244
00:21:24,015 --> 00:21:26,977
You had time to get the police.
You didn't do that, either.

245
00:21:27,060 --> 00:21:30,230
You're guilty of murder,
premeditated and with vengeance.

246
00:21:30,313 --> 00:21:32,524
That's first-degree murder
in any court of law.

247
00:21:32,649 --> 00:21:36,111
- So I should plead guilty?
- When I advise you to cop out, you'll know.

248
00:21:36,194 --> 00:21:38,738
- Cop out?
- That's plead guilty and ask for mercy.

249
00:21:38,989 --> 00:21:42,242
If you're not telling me to cop out,
what are you telling me?

250
00:21:42,367 --> 00:21:44,161
I'm not telling you to do anything.

251
00:21:44,286 --> 00:21:47,747
I just want you to understand
the letter of the law.

252
00:21:50,375 --> 00:21:52,669
- Go on.
- Go on with what?

253
00:21:55,255 --> 00:21:57,757
Whatever it is you're getting at.

254
00:22:02,762 --> 00:22:04,389
You're very bright.

255
00:22:05,098 --> 00:22:08,893
Let's see how really bright you can be.

256
00:22:11,980 --> 00:22:14,899
Well, I'm working at it.

257
00:22:16,985 --> 00:22:21,406
Because your wife was raped, you'll have
a favourable atmosphere in the courtroom.

258
00:22:21,489 --> 00:22:24,284
The sympathy will be with you
if all the facts are true.

259
00:22:24,367 --> 00:22:26,036
What you need is a legal peg...

260
00:22:26,161 --> 00:22:28,997
...so the jury can hang up
their sympathy in your behalf.

261
00:22:29,080 --> 00:22:31,416
- You follow me?
- Yes.

262
00:22:32,751 --> 00:22:35,211
What's your legal excuse, Lieutenant?

263
00:22:36,379 --> 00:22:39,716
What's your legal excuse
for killing Barney Quill?

264
00:22:42,177 --> 00:22:43,928
Not justification, huh?

265
00:22:44,721 --> 00:22:46,389
Not justification.

266
00:22:51,269 --> 00:22:52,771
Excuse.

267
00:22:56,399 --> 00:22:57,692
Just excuse, huh?

268
00:23:12,290 --> 00:23:13,958
What excuses are there?

269
00:23:14,626 --> 00:23:18,171
How should I know?
You're the one that plugged Quill.

270
00:23:18,713 --> 00:23:20,214
I must've been mad.

271
00:23:20,673 --> 00:23:24,218
- How's that?
- I said I must've been mad.

272
00:23:28,848 --> 00:23:30,934
A bad temper's no excuse.

273
00:23:33,269 --> 00:23:36,272
I mean, I must've been crazy.

274
00:23:41,277 --> 00:23:43,571
Am I getting warmer?

275
00:23:48,451 --> 00:23:50,328
Okay, Sulo. I'm going...

276
00:23:51,371 --> 00:23:52,872
Am I getting warmer?

277
00:23:53,373 --> 00:23:56,250
I'll tell you that
after I've talked to your wife.

278
00:23:56,334 --> 00:24:00,088
In the meantime, see if you can remember
just how crazy you were.

279
00:24:07,178 --> 00:24:09,263
Is Mrs. Manion here yet?

280
00:24:09,472 --> 00:24:11,557
She's been waiting quite a while.

281
00:24:11,641 --> 00:24:14,977
She's been through all your albums
from Dixieland to Brubeck.

282
00:24:15,061 --> 00:24:16,646
What do you think of her?

283
00:24:16,729 --> 00:24:21,442
Soft, easy. The kind men
like to take advantage of, and do.

284
00:24:22,401 --> 00:24:23,736
Did you get any money?

285
00:24:23,820 --> 00:24:25,488
- Huh?
- Money.

286
00:24:26,822 --> 00:24:31,911
I haven't decided to take the case yet.
You surprise me, sometimes.

287
00:24:32,703 --> 00:24:34,997
Why? I've been around.

288
00:24:35,623 --> 00:24:36,874
Yeah, well...

289
00:24:44,173 --> 00:24:46,467
- Hi.
- Hi.

290
00:24:53,599 --> 00:24:57,269
I hope you don't mind.
I think we'd better talk.

291
00:24:57,937 --> 00:25:02,108
You're a funny kind of a lawyer.
The music, I mean.

292
00:25:02,483 --> 00:25:04,985
Aren't lawyers supposed to like music?

293
00:25:05,236 --> 00:25:07,321
Not that kind of music.

294
00:25:07,655 --> 00:25:10,991
I guess that settles it.
I'm a funny kind of a lawyer.

295
00:25:11,075 --> 00:25:14,036
Where's your home, Mrs. Manion?
Where'd you go to school?

296
00:25:14,120 --> 00:25:15,705
Where did you grow up?

297
00:25:15,788 --> 00:25:20,334
No place in particular. We moved around.
My father was a boomer.

298
00:25:20,418 --> 00:25:25,005
Construction boomer.
Building dams mostly. Call me Laura.

299
00:25:26,507 --> 00:25:29,427
- Is your family still alive, Laura?
- No.

300
00:25:30,010 --> 00:25:32,304
I have some cigarettes
around here someplace.

301
00:25:32,429 --> 00:25:34,890
- Want a cigarette?
- No, I wanted to offer you one.

302
00:25:34,974 --> 00:25:37,268
- You could light it for me.
- Oh, yes.

303
00:25:39,395 --> 00:25:40,437
Here.

304
00:25:41,605 --> 00:25:44,733
That's just like your husband's, isn't it?

305
00:25:46,777 --> 00:25:50,072
He gave me this because I liked the one
he had. He's like that.

306
00:25:50,155 --> 00:25:51,699
He gives me presents all the time.

307
00:25:51,782 --> 00:25:53,325
You have a happy marriage?

308
00:25:54,660 --> 00:25:55,786
Yes.

309
00:25:56,662 --> 00:25:59,206
What went wrong with the first marriage?

310
00:25:59,290 --> 00:26:02,167
What went wrong
is when I went for Manny.

311
00:26:02,710 --> 00:26:05,754
- That's honest enough.
- It was more than just that.

312
00:26:05,838 --> 00:26:10,301
Like I told you, I grew up on the move,
and Jack, my first husband...

313
00:26:10,426 --> 00:26:11,760
...didn't like to move.

314
00:26:11,844 --> 00:26:14,179
He wouldn't even take a transfer.

315
00:26:14,263 --> 00:26:18,892
I was really bored. Manny likes to go.
We're always going.

316
00:26:18,976 --> 00:26:21,603
Whenever we get the chance.
We've been all over.

317
00:26:21,687 --> 00:26:22,896
I'm thirsty.

318
00:26:23,522 --> 00:26:25,149
Water? Or would a beer do?

319
00:26:25,232 --> 00:26:27,151
I think a beer would do fine.

320
00:26:28,068 --> 00:26:30,654
Bring me a bottle of beer, will you?

321
00:26:32,322 --> 00:26:34,700
- Are you married?
- No.

322
00:26:35,701 --> 00:26:37,161
That's nice.

323
00:26:38,203 --> 00:26:41,206
What do you do alone in this house
if you aren't married?

324
00:26:41,290 --> 00:26:43,792
It's a family home.
I'm the last of the family...

325
00:26:43,876 --> 00:26:45,627
- There you are.
- Thank you.

326
00:26:47,296 --> 00:26:50,674
- Aren't you having one?
- No, not right now.

327
00:26:51,508 --> 00:26:52,759
There you are.

328
00:26:53,427 --> 00:26:56,597
Could Muff have a little?
In that ashtray, maybe? He loves beer.

329
00:26:56,847 --> 00:26:59,725
You want a beer for the dog?

330
00:27:00,559 --> 00:27:02,227
Well, here we are.

331
00:27:06,899 --> 00:27:08,775
He'll go to sleep now.

332
00:27:12,112 --> 00:27:13,780
- Isn't he cute?
- Yeah.

333
00:27:14,698 --> 00:27:17,409
Well, how about it? Are you ready?

334
00:27:18,619 --> 00:27:21,538
I mean, are you ready to tell me the story?

335
00:27:21,830 --> 00:27:23,707
I know what you mean.

336
00:27:25,083 --> 00:27:28,337
Suppose you tell me
everything you told the state police...

337
00:27:28,462 --> 00:27:32,007
...plus, everything you didn't tell
the state police.

338
00:27:32,507 --> 00:27:34,009
Where shall I begin?

339
00:27:34,134 --> 00:27:36,845
What time did you leave for Quill's bar?

340
00:27:37,095 --> 00:27:40,015
Right after dinner. About 8:30, I guess.

341
00:27:40,140 --> 00:27:44,061
Manny was late getting home
from the firing range. So, we had dinner.

342
00:27:44,186 --> 00:27:45,812
He laid down and went to sleep.

343
00:27:45,896 --> 00:27:50,192
I hadn't been out of the trailer all day,
so I took Muff and a flashlight...

344
00:27:50,275 --> 00:27:51,818
...and walked over to the bar.

345
00:27:51,902 --> 00:27:54,321
I bought a drink
and played the pinball machine.

346
00:27:54,404 --> 00:27:56,490
Many people in the bar?

347
00:27:56,948 --> 00:28:01,745
Not many. Barney came over
and challenged me to a game. For drinks.

348
00:28:01,953 --> 00:28:03,914
How well did you know Barney?

349
00:28:03,997 --> 00:28:07,459
He owned this bar where Manny and I went
sometimes, that's all.

350
00:28:07,918 --> 00:28:11,838
- Had he ever made a pass at you?
- No, nothing like that at all.

351
00:28:12,255 --> 00:28:14,591
Was he drinking heavily that night?

352
00:28:15,550 --> 00:28:18,887
He didn't seem to be.
At least, not when we were playing pinball.

353
00:28:19,012 --> 00:28:21,640
Were you with him
the whole time you were there?

354
00:28:21,765 --> 00:28:23,767
No, there were other people playing.

355
00:28:23,850 --> 00:28:26,353
What time did you leave the bar?

356
00:28:26,895 --> 00:28:28,647
About 11:00, I guess.

357
00:28:29,898 --> 00:28:32,984
I left by the side door.
Muff was carrying the flashlight.

358
00:28:33,068 --> 00:28:34,611
He carries it in his mouth.

359
00:28:34,736 --> 00:28:37,155
He's so cute,
running along with the light shining.

360
00:28:37,239 --> 00:28:38,406
Was he sober?

361
00:28:38,490 --> 00:28:41,910
Muff? Of course he was sober.
You're joking now, aren't you?

362
00:28:42,327 --> 00:28:45,038
Yes, I'm joking. Go on.

363
00:28:45,789 --> 00:28:49,542
Well, Barney came from somewhere,
not the door I left by.

364
00:28:49,834 --> 00:28:53,004
He said he was going my way
and he could drive me home.

365
00:28:53,088 --> 00:28:56,800
He said the bears were prowling around
and I oughtn't to walk home.

366
00:28:57,008 --> 00:28:59,386
The bears come out at night to scavenge.

367
00:28:59,469 --> 00:29:01,388
They're harmless enough, aren't they?

368
00:29:01,471 --> 00:29:04,641
I suppose I wouldn't have been afraid
in the daylight, but...

369
00:29:04,724 --> 00:29:06,267
...the dark isn't the same.

370
00:29:06,393 --> 00:29:09,062
Yes, I know.
Now, you got into Barney's car...

371
00:29:09,270 --> 00:29:11,564
I got in and he drove to the trailer park.

372
00:29:11,898 --> 00:29:13,566
He made overtures?

373
00:29:13,900 --> 00:29:15,026
No, nothing.

374
00:29:15,110 --> 00:29:18,071
When we got to the trailer park,
the auto-gate was closed.

375
00:29:18,196 --> 00:29:21,741
Mr. Lemon closes it about 11:00,
or a little after.

376
00:29:21,825 --> 00:29:24,619
I thanked Barney
and started to get out of the car...

377
00:29:24,702 --> 00:29:27,413
...but he said
there wasn't any need for me to walk.

378
00:29:27,539 --> 00:29:30,416
That he could drive me into the park
on another road.

379
00:29:30,500 --> 00:29:33,837
I didn't know there was another road,
but he drove on...

380
00:29:33,962 --> 00:29:35,880
...before I could say yes or no.

381
00:29:35,964 --> 00:29:40,301
- Were you alarmed?
- No, I'm not usually afraid of men.

382
00:29:40,385 --> 00:29:43,847
And anyway, he hadn't touched me
or even said anything out of the way.

383
00:29:44,722 --> 00:29:49,352
Doesn't a woman sort of instinctively know
when a fellow's on the make?

384
00:29:49,852 --> 00:29:54,148
Sure, but that's only usual with me,
with almost all men.

385
00:29:54,232 --> 00:29:58,236
Ever since I was a kid.
You, for instance. You're interested.

386
00:29:58,695 --> 00:30:02,740
But there isn't any reason to be afraid
of you. It was like that with Barney.

387
00:30:02,865 --> 00:30:05,368
Mrs. Manion, believe me,
I'm not in the least...

388
00:30:05,451 --> 00:30:07,120
Call me Laura.

389
00:30:08,871 --> 00:30:13,710
Laura, I'm only interested in helping
your husband. Nothing more.

390
00:30:14,168 --> 00:30:16,337
I don't mean you'd try anything.

391
00:30:16,421 --> 00:30:19,757
I just mean, it's the way you look at me.

392
00:30:21,718 --> 00:30:24,095
It would be very difficult
not to look at you.

393
00:30:24,303 --> 00:30:26,931
The way I dress, you mean?
You don't like it?

394
00:30:27,098 --> 00:30:29,851
I love it. I just love it.

395
00:30:30,977 --> 00:30:33,980
We'd better keep moving along
with this thing.

396
00:30:36,232 --> 00:30:38,025
How were you dressed that night?

397
00:30:38,526 --> 00:30:40,945
In a sweater, like this, and a skirt.

398
00:30:41,154 --> 00:30:43,489
And the rest? What about that?

399
00:30:43,698 --> 00:30:47,452
Underneath? I had on a slip
and panties and a bra.

400
00:30:48,244 --> 00:30:49,495
No girdle?

401
00:30:49,579 --> 00:30:52,582
I don't need a girdle.
Do you think I need a girdle?

402
00:30:53,207 --> 00:30:56,335
I don't know. How should...

403
00:30:57,336 --> 00:31:01,924
I'm only concerned with the few facts
that might be of help to me...

404
00:31:02,008 --> 00:31:04,218
...to defend your husband. That's all.

405
00:31:04,302 --> 00:31:06,762
- Well, I don't wear one.
- Okay, no girdle.

406
00:31:08,014 --> 00:31:09,640
All right. Now, go on.

407
00:31:09,765 --> 00:31:14,186
He turned off the highway into a lane
in the woods, and he stopped the car...

408
00:31:14,312 --> 00:31:16,105
...and turned off the lights.

409
00:31:16,230 --> 00:31:20,901
And then he grabbed me and he said,
"I'm gonna rape you." Just like that.

410
00:31:20,985 --> 00:31:22,028
He used those words?

411
00:31:22,111 --> 00:31:26,699
Exactly those words. Muff began to bark,
so he threw him out the window.

412
00:31:26,782 --> 00:31:30,453
I could hear little Muffy whining
outside the car, all through it.

413
00:31:30,578 --> 00:31:35,458
Barney began to try to get at me
and I fought him off as best I could.

414
00:31:35,541 --> 00:31:37,126
But he was terribly strong.

415
00:31:37,209 --> 00:31:39,211
Did you cry out? Did you scream?

416
00:31:39,587 --> 00:31:42,214
Didn't seem to be much use,
out there in the woods.

417
00:31:42,340 --> 00:31:47,178
He began to shout names at me
like "army slut" and some other names.

418
00:31:47,303 --> 00:31:49,930
Then, he drew back
and hit me with his fist.

419
00:31:50,014 --> 00:31:52,933
He hit me again and I didn't fight anymore.

420
00:31:53,017 --> 00:31:55,895
I must've been only half-conscious...

421
00:31:56,771 --> 00:32:00,274
...but I know that he tore my panties off
and did what he wanted.

422
00:32:01,317 --> 00:32:03,569
The newspapers said
a doctor examined you...

423
00:32:03,652 --> 00:32:05,738
...and he didn't think you'd been raped.

424
00:32:05,821 --> 00:32:09,533
I don't care what the doctor thought,
a woman doesn't mistake these things.

425
00:32:09,617 --> 00:32:12,286
All right. Go ahead.

426
00:32:15,748 --> 00:32:19,251
I don't know exactly what happened then,
I must've fainted.

427
00:32:19,335 --> 00:32:21,462
The next thing I remember,
the car was moving.

428
00:32:21,545 --> 00:32:26,133
Barney was driving very fast
and he was breathing hard.

429
00:32:26,842 --> 00:32:29,136
An ugly, gasping sound.

430
00:32:30,262 --> 00:32:32,765
We were on the main road
to the trailer park...

431
00:32:32,848 --> 00:32:35,601
...and he swung in by the gate
and stopped.

432
00:32:35,684 --> 00:32:37,228
I opened the door to get out.

433
00:32:37,353 --> 00:32:40,064
Muffy jumped out
with a lighted flashlight in his mouth.

434
00:32:40,147 --> 00:32:41,315
Wait a minute.

435
00:32:41,440 --> 00:32:44,693
You said he'd thrown Muff out of the car,
back in the woods.

436
00:32:45,027 --> 00:32:49,281
He did, but he must've let him back in.
I don't remember.

437
00:32:49,657 --> 00:32:52,576
All right. You opened the door
and Muff got out first.

438
00:32:53,202 --> 00:32:56,497
Before I could get out, Barney grabbed me
and said he was gonna...

439
00:32:56,622 --> 00:32:58,999
...tear all my clothes off
and attack me again.

440
00:32:59,124 --> 00:33:00,334
I got away and ran.

441
00:33:00,459 --> 00:33:02,586
I could see Muff at an opening in the fence.

442
00:33:02,670 --> 00:33:05,881
He was scooting back and forth
with the flashlight.

443
00:33:06,090 --> 00:33:10,052
Barney caught me from behind
and I fell to the ground.

444
00:33:10,135 --> 00:33:13,013
He fell on top of me
and began to beat me with his fists.

445
00:33:13,097 --> 00:33:14,890
I thought he was gonna kill me.

446
00:33:15,015 --> 00:33:19,186
I screamed and somehow
I got to my feet again and ran.

447
00:33:19,394 --> 00:33:22,439
I went through the opening in the fence,
followed Muffy...

448
00:33:22,523 --> 00:33:24,858
...who was running ahead
with the flashlight.

449
00:33:24,942 --> 00:33:27,736
I kept following the light
until he led me to our trailer.

450
00:33:27,945 --> 00:33:29,988
And you didn't see Barney again?

451
00:33:30,072 --> 00:33:33,200
I never laid eyes on him again,
dead or alive.

452
00:33:34,451 --> 00:33:37,454
I think that's enough for now.

453
00:33:38,622 --> 00:33:40,999
I've got lots of time. All you want.

454
00:33:42,584 --> 00:33:43,961
Where can I reach you?

455
00:33:44,086 --> 00:33:47,881
I'm still in Thunder Bay,
but I can drive down again in the morning.

456
00:33:51,218 --> 00:33:54,137
- Was there something else?
- No.

457
00:34:06,608 --> 00:34:10,696
- Thanks for letting me play the records.
- You're very welcome.

458
00:34:14,741 --> 00:34:18,078
- Who was that?
- The lady in the case.

459
00:34:21,581 --> 00:34:23,458
You're not gonna take the case?

460
00:34:23,542 --> 00:34:27,212
I don't know. That depends on
what Manion has to tell me tomorrow.

461
00:34:27,295 --> 00:34:29,381
He's thinking things out.

462
00:34:30,298 --> 00:34:32,134
That's more like it.

463
00:34:33,009 --> 00:34:35,887
If I take the case, I'll want you in it.

464
00:34:36,179 --> 00:34:38,682
Me? In a big murder case?

465
00:34:40,475 --> 00:34:45,021
The sight of this whiskey-drinking old man
at the counsel table would ruin you.

466
00:34:45,105 --> 00:34:46,565
I need you.

467
00:34:47,607 --> 00:34:49,151
You mean that?

468
00:34:49,526 --> 00:34:51,611
Why else would he say it?

469
00:34:52,612 --> 00:34:56,992
I'll be glad to work with you outside
the courtroom, but not in the courtroom.

470
00:34:57,200 --> 00:34:58,910
You suit yourself about that.

471
00:34:59,035 --> 00:35:02,789
Either way, I'm gonna have to be able
to depend on you.

472
00:35:03,790 --> 00:35:06,084
Will you lay off the booze?

473
00:35:13,466 --> 00:35:15,510
I don't know about that.

474
00:35:15,677 --> 00:35:17,470
Why don't you know?

475
00:35:20,015 --> 00:35:22,934
Do you think I could lay off the booze?

476
00:35:23,560 --> 00:35:25,520
Have you ever tried it?

477
00:35:27,939 --> 00:35:29,190
Try it.

478
00:35:33,737 --> 00:35:38,325
I've never been in a big murder case.
Not once in all my life.

479
00:35:39,701 --> 00:35:41,453
Well, it's up to you, Parn.

480
00:35:48,793 --> 00:35:50,587
Will you be around tonight?

481
00:35:53,256 --> 00:35:55,550
Yeah, I'll be around.

482
00:36:03,725 --> 00:36:07,479
Maida, darling, I might manage it.

483
00:36:09,522 --> 00:36:12,192
I might manage to be a real lawyer again...

484
00:36:13,651 --> 00:36:15,612
...for a little while, anyway.

485
00:36:19,032 --> 00:36:23,077
I tried remembering.
There were still some pieces missing.

486
00:36:25,330 --> 00:36:27,248
I remember...

487
00:36:28,666 --> 00:36:31,169
...going to Quill's bar with a gun.

488
00:36:32,420 --> 00:36:35,548
And I remember Quill's face
behind the bar...

489
00:36:36,716 --> 00:36:40,136
...but I don't remember anything else.
Not even going home.

490
00:36:40,219 --> 00:36:42,263
Don't you remember firing the gun?

491
00:36:42,347 --> 00:36:44,515
Five shots. That's a lot of noise to forget.

492
00:36:44,599 --> 00:36:48,561
I remember hearing shots,
but they don't seem connected with me.

493
00:36:48,686 --> 00:36:53,274
They seemed far away, like somebody else
was doing the shooting.

494
00:36:58,237 --> 00:37:01,574
Lt. Manion, I'll take your case.

495
00:37:02,658 --> 00:37:05,411
Thanks, Mr. Biegler.

496
00:37:05,536 --> 00:37:07,789
There's the little matter of the fee.

497
00:37:07,955 --> 00:37:10,833
$3,000. That's reasonable enough, isn't it?

498
00:37:10,958 --> 00:37:12,293
More than reasonable.

499
00:37:12,376 --> 00:37:13,920
I'll pay you later. I'm broke.

500
00:37:14,045 --> 00:37:16,672
- You're what?
- I'm flat busted.

501
00:37:16,756 --> 00:37:19,050
I don't have $3, much less $3,000.

502
00:37:19,133 --> 00:37:20,468
Can you raise it?

503
00:37:20,551 --> 00:37:22,845
Yeah, as soon as I get out of jail.

504
00:37:24,514 --> 00:37:29,310
Next week's payday,
I'll be able to give you $150.

505
00:37:29,393 --> 00:37:32,563
If you get me off,
I'll give you a promissory note for the rest.

506
00:37:32,647 --> 00:37:36,817
Suppose I don't go along with you
unless you pay me half the fee?

507
00:37:37,443 --> 00:37:41,739
I'll have to take a lawyer
the court appoints. I got my defence now.

508
00:37:41,822 --> 00:37:43,699
Right? Insanity?

509
00:37:44,033 --> 00:37:46,869
I think I'll stick around
and make damn sure you get off.

510
00:37:46,953 --> 00:37:50,706
- Where do we start?
- We're gonna need a psychiatrist.

511
00:37:51,374 --> 00:37:53,084
As neither one of us has money...

512
00:37:53,209 --> 00:37:55,920
...do you think
the Army'll stir one up for you?

513
00:37:56,003 --> 00:37:58,256
I know a colonel in the Pentagon. I'll write.

514
00:37:58,339 --> 00:37:59,715
Good, do that. Sulo?

515
00:38:05,805 --> 00:38:07,306
Where are you going now?

516
00:38:07,390 --> 00:38:09,892
I'm going to see your wife, for one thing.

517
00:38:10,101 --> 00:38:12,269
Why? Didn't you see her yesterday?

518
00:38:12,395 --> 00:38:16,190
That's right, I did.
She's a very pretty woman, your wife.

519
00:38:17,233 --> 00:38:19,276
A man gets used to the way his wife looks.

520
00:38:19,402 --> 00:38:22,321
Yeah, I guess he does. I'll see you.

521
00:38:40,131 --> 00:38:42,007
Come on in, Pauly.

522
00:38:42,508 --> 00:38:45,469
You haven't been in here
since you vacated.

523
00:38:45,553 --> 00:38:48,430
Hardly recognise the old place?
Mary did it for me.

524
00:38:48,639 --> 00:38:51,976
She just finished a decorator's course.
Smart girl.

525
00:38:52,059 --> 00:38:55,813
- Look at this, a real genuine Picasso print.
- Very nice.

526
00:38:56,105 --> 00:38:59,108
Try this chair.
It sort of does things for you.

527
00:38:59,191 --> 00:39:01,360
Here, sit right down.

528
00:39:02,319 --> 00:39:04,613
Great, isn't it?
"Good for the nerves," they say.

529
00:39:04,780 --> 00:39:06,740
How do you shut it off?

530
00:39:06,824 --> 00:39:09,285
Here we are. Feel better?

531
00:39:09,410 --> 00:39:11,245
I feel all shook up.

532
00:39:13,664 --> 00:39:17,334
I just dropped by to tell you
I've got both feet in the Manion case.

533
00:39:17,418 --> 00:39:19,587
- You're going to cop out, aren't you?
- No.

534
00:39:19,712 --> 00:39:21,797
That's a mistake. It's open and shut.

535
00:39:22,006 --> 00:39:23,424
Maybe. We'll see.

536
00:39:23,549 --> 00:39:25,050
Judge Maitland's in the hospital.

537
00:39:25,175 --> 00:39:27,970
Maybe you'd like a continuance
until he gets back.

538
00:39:28,053 --> 00:39:29,888
If we go now, we'll have to try...

539
00:39:29,972 --> 00:39:32,391
...before some grab-bag judge
they'll send in.

540
00:39:32,474 --> 00:39:35,060
- I'd rather have Maitland.
- Yeah, so would I.

541
00:39:35,144 --> 00:39:39,106
But, of course, that also means my client
lies around in jail another two...

542
00:39:39,189 --> 00:39:41,316
...or three months before the trial.

543
00:39:41,942 --> 00:39:44,194
If you drop the charge
down to manslaughter...

544
00:39:44,319 --> 00:39:47,197
...so he can get out on bail,
we'll agree to a continuance.

545
00:39:47,281 --> 00:39:49,742
You wouldn't do that if you were still D.A.

546
00:39:49,825 --> 00:39:51,702
I don't know, I might.

547
00:39:52,202 --> 00:39:55,998
I might, since a big fat lie-detector test
on his wife has given proof...

548
00:39:56,081 --> 00:39:58,667
...to the rape story.
The jury'll be with him.

549
00:39:58,751 --> 00:40:00,836
How did you know what the lie...

550
00:40:01,420 --> 00:40:03,088
- Bit, didn't I?
- Yeah, you did.

551
00:40:03,172 --> 00:40:05,757
A lie-detector test
isn't admissible evidence.

552
00:40:05,841 --> 00:40:07,009
You can't use it.

553
00:40:07,092 --> 00:40:13,015
No, but it carries moral weight.
I wouldn't sit in that chair too much.

554
00:40:13,098 --> 00:40:16,852
It could shake a fellow's brains loose.
I'll see you later.

555
00:40:26,403 --> 00:40:28,363
He remembers you, Paul. He likes you.

556
00:40:28,447 --> 00:40:32,826
He likes the beer in my icebox.
What's the occasion today, a buffalo hunt?

557
00:40:32,910 --> 00:40:36,163
No, I bought these in Arizona
when we were stationed there.

558
00:40:36,288 --> 00:40:37,998
Aren't they smart?

559
00:40:38,081 --> 00:40:39,916
We can sit in my car.

560
00:40:47,257 --> 00:40:48,467
Here you are.

561
00:40:52,012 --> 00:40:54,306
Several things have occurred to me.

562
00:40:56,558 --> 00:41:00,020
The undergarments
that Barney Quill tore off:

563
00:41:00,103 --> 00:41:02,439
Who has them now? The police?

564
00:41:02,606 --> 00:41:04,483
You mean my panties?

565
00:41:04,775 --> 00:41:06,651
All right, your panties.

566
00:41:06,777 --> 00:41:08,278
I haven't seen them since.

567
00:41:08,361 --> 00:41:11,239
I gave the torn skirt and sweater
to the police.

568
00:41:11,323 --> 00:41:14,576
Then I went with them into the woods
to look for the panties...

569
00:41:14,659 --> 00:41:17,037
...but we couldn't find anything
but my glasses.

570
00:41:17,120 --> 00:41:18,455
Your glasses!

571
00:41:18,580 --> 00:41:21,458
You mean,
you were wearing glasses through all that?

572
00:41:21,666 --> 00:41:23,376
I had them in a case in my hand.

573
00:41:23,502 --> 00:41:26,379
I wear them for reading,
playing pinball, things like that.

574
00:41:26,463 --> 00:41:30,091
I must've tried to get out of the car
and dropped them.

575
00:41:30,884 --> 00:41:35,055
You might be interested to know
that your lie-detector test turned out...

576
00:41:35,180 --> 00:41:36,932
...in your favour.

577
00:41:37,015 --> 00:41:39,559
Of course it did.
I could've told you it would.

578
00:41:39,643 --> 00:41:41,353
You weren't worried about it?

579
00:41:41,436 --> 00:41:43,521
No, why should I be?

580
00:41:45,232 --> 00:41:48,401
Would you like to have something
to worry about?

581
00:41:48,485 --> 00:41:49,736
Silly.

582
00:41:49,819 --> 00:41:53,365
Like your husband watching us
from his cell window?

583
00:41:57,911 --> 00:41:59,788
All right, let's have it.

584
00:42:00,747 --> 00:42:02,332
Did he say something to you?

585
00:42:02,415 --> 00:42:05,335
Just enough. Are you afraid of him?

586
00:42:06,711 --> 00:42:07,963
Yes.

587
00:42:08,505 --> 00:42:11,591
Is that why you volunteered
for a lie-detector test? For him?

588
00:42:11,716 --> 00:42:12,759
Yeah.

589
00:42:13,593 --> 00:42:16,304
Does he have reason to be jealous?

590
00:42:16,971 --> 00:42:19,140
He was jealous
even before we were married.

591
00:42:19,265 --> 00:42:21,768
I should've known how it would be.

592
00:42:22,018 --> 00:42:24,771
It's funny, though.
He likes to show me off.

593
00:42:24,854 --> 00:42:28,066
He likes me to dress the way I do,
and then he gets furious...

594
00:42:28,149 --> 00:42:33,154
...if a man pays any attention to me.
I've tried to leave him, but I can't.

595
00:42:33,321 --> 00:42:35,198
He begs, I give in.

596
00:42:36,449 --> 00:42:40,203
Now, if you think
I've forgotten my question, I haven't.

597
00:42:40,995 --> 00:42:42,455
I have.

598
00:42:43,164 --> 00:42:48,169
Then I'll ask it again. Does your husband
have any reason to be jealous?

599
00:42:50,171 --> 00:42:52,674
No. Not once.

600
00:42:53,174 --> 00:42:54,676
Not ever.

601
00:45:13,647 --> 00:45:14,982
Like the place all right?

602
00:45:15,065 --> 00:45:18,736
I was just looking at those pictures.
That was Barney Quill, wasn't it?

603
00:45:18,819 --> 00:45:22,031
- That's right. Barney Quill.
- I'm Paul Biegler...

604
00:45:22,114 --> 00:45:25,451
I know who you are.
I've seen you around Iron City.

605
00:45:25,784 --> 00:45:27,495
You didn't tell me your name.

606
00:45:27,578 --> 00:45:29,997
Paquette. We don't open till 5:00.

607
00:45:30,080 --> 00:45:33,834
That's all right. I can wait.
I don't have the shakes yet.

608
00:45:34,585 --> 00:45:37,171
You were on the job that night,
weren't you?

609
00:45:37,296 --> 00:45:39,215
The night Barney Quill was killed.

610
00:45:39,298 --> 00:45:41,634
Like the newspaper said, I was present.

611
00:45:41,717 --> 00:45:45,221
You were the fellow
that stopped Lt. Manion outside.

612
00:45:45,304 --> 00:45:46,430
That's right.

613
00:45:46,597 --> 00:45:50,392
He pointed the gun at me and said,
"You want some too, buster?"

614
00:45:50,476 --> 00:45:53,812
And you said no,
because your name isn't Buster.

615
00:45:53,896 --> 00:45:55,522
Wasn't anything funny about it.

616
00:45:55,648 --> 00:45:58,567
No, there wasn't anything... I'm sorry.

617
00:45:58,859 --> 00:46:01,612
Where were you
when Barney Quill was killed?

618
00:46:05,157 --> 00:46:07,993
I gather you don't want to talk
about that night?

619
00:46:08,077 --> 00:46:10,329
That's right. I don't want to talk about it.

620
00:46:10,412 --> 00:46:13,749
You'll have to talk to me about it in court,
why not now?

621
00:46:13,916 --> 00:46:16,710
'Cause I don't have to now.
Reason enough, okay?

622
00:46:16,794 --> 00:46:17,836
Okay.

623
00:46:20,839 --> 00:46:23,717
Old Barney, he was
kind of a rugged character, wasn't he?

624
00:46:23,842 --> 00:46:27,554
Ex-prize fighter and muscleman,
and fancy with guns.

625
00:46:28,222 --> 00:46:31,975
He paid his debts, ran a clean place.
Me, I liked him.

626
00:46:32,101 --> 00:46:33,602
You run the place now?

627
00:46:33,685 --> 00:46:36,814
No, I just work here.
Mary's running things.

628
00:46:37,272 --> 00:46:39,483
Mary? Was that Barney's wife?

629
00:46:39,566 --> 00:46:42,569
No. He didn't have a wife.
Mary was his manager.

630
00:46:44,279 --> 00:46:46,698
I wonder who's going to inherit the place.

631
00:46:46,782 --> 00:46:49,993
- Mary, I guess.
- Mary again, huh?

632
00:46:50,202 --> 00:46:51,745
What's the matter with that?

633
00:46:51,829 --> 00:46:55,749
You mean, what's the matter with Mary?
I don't know.

634
00:46:55,832 --> 00:46:57,084
Mary what?

635
00:46:57,584 --> 00:46:59,127
Pilant. Mary Pilant.

636
00:46:59,253 --> 00:47:01,004
She's in the back booth.

637
00:47:01,088 --> 00:47:05,801
We don't talk about our customers here,
but if we did, which we don't...

638
00:47:07,719 --> 00:47:10,222
That's her. That's Mary Pilant.

639
00:47:19,314 --> 00:47:21,274
Do you know Lt. Manion's wife?

640
00:47:21,358 --> 00:47:24,987
Sure. I know the lieutenant, too.
He's a good officer.

641
00:47:25,445 --> 00:47:28,532
She's all right, too. Friendly, a good kid.

642
00:47:29,116 --> 00:47:32,828
- What do you know? Knock it off.
- I didn't mean anything. She's a dish.

643
00:47:32,911 --> 00:47:34,204
What's wrong with that?

644
00:47:34,287 --> 00:47:39,501
You want this lawyer to get wrong ideas?
What chances has the lieutenant got?

645
00:47:40,043 --> 00:47:43,839
Pretty good, I'd say, with a couple
of character witnesses like you.

646
00:47:45,215 --> 00:47:48,385
I'd like to help him out,
I sure would, but we're moving out.

647
00:47:48,468 --> 00:47:50,595
The whole outfit. Berlin.

648
00:47:52,347 --> 00:47:55,475
Tell me, who is this "babe" at the hotel?

649
00:47:56,017 --> 00:48:00,188
Her name is Mary Pilant.
She was Quill's private property.

650
00:48:13,368 --> 00:48:16,079
- Would you like a table, sir?
- Yes, please.

651
00:48:22,127 --> 00:48:23,295
Will you be alone?

652
00:48:23,378 --> 00:48:25,672
No, I'll be joined by two others.

653
00:48:25,964 --> 00:48:29,217
- May I take your hat?
- Thank you very much.

654
00:48:36,933 --> 00:48:38,143
How was the manicure?

655
00:48:38,226 --> 00:48:41,604
Ask me any questions about anybody.
I've got all the dope.

656
00:48:41,688 --> 00:48:44,899
Can you tell me about a woman
by the name of Mary Pilant?

657
00:48:45,025 --> 00:48:48,737
Easy. Mary Pilant may
or may not have been...

658
00:48:48,820 --> 00:48:51,072
...the mistress of the late B. Quill.

659
00:48:51,156 --> 00:48:53,825
The manicurist is in favour
of the mistress theory...

660
00:48:53,908 --> 00:48:55,744
...but the hairdresser is against it.

661
00:48:55,827 --> 00:49:00,707
However, they both agree that some kind
of hanky-panky must've been going on.

662
00:49:00,832 --> 00:49:02,083
To be continued.

663
00:49:02,167 --> 00:49:04,044
- Menu?
- Thank you.

664
00:49:06,337 --> 00:49:09,674
- Pretty, huh?
- Yes, very pretty. Well, go on.

665
00:49:10,675 --> 00:49:15,513
There's one story that says that Barney's
wild night with Mrs. Manion was...

666
00:49:15,597 --> 00:49:18,433
...somehow triggered by Mary Pilant.

667
00:49:18,558 --> 00:49:22,312
Seemed she'd been seeing some soldier
and Barney blew his stack.

668
00:49:22,395 --> 00:49:24,105
He got tanked up and exploded.

669
00:49:24,189 --> 00:49:27,275
- Is Mary Pilant local?
- No, she's a Canadian.

670
00:49:27,358 --> 00:49:29,486
Barney brought her in
to dress up the place...

671
00:49:29,569 --> 00:49:33,489
...and she stayed on to manage it for him.
Looks like she's done all right.

672
00:49:33,573 --> 00:49:36,367
It's better than all right.
She's in for the estate.

673
00:49:37,577 --> 00:49:40,914
She doesn't look like a bad sort, does she?

674
00:49:41,122 --> 00:49:42,165
Where?

675
00:49:42,248 --> 00:49:45,668
What do you mean, "where"?
The pretty one with the menus.

676
00:49:45,752 --> 00:49:47,670
This girl, right here?

677
00:49:52,675 --> 00:49:55,637
Miss Pilant, may I introduce myself?

678
00:49:55,762 --> 00:49:58,264
I'm Paul Biegler, attorney for Lt. Manion.

679
00:49:58,348 --> 00:50:01,351
This is Mrs. Rutledge and Mr. McCarthy,
my associates.

680
00:50:01,434 --> 00:50:03,311
Could you sit with us for a minute?

681
00:50:03,394 --> 00:50:05,688
- Yes, I can take a minute.
- Thank you.

682
00:50:07,565 --> 00:50:11,110
I'd like to ask you a few things,
if you don't mind.

683
00:50:11,361 --> 00:50:13,863
What sort of things, Mr. Biegler?

684
00:50:14,030 --> 00:50:17,075
Like, what kind of man your employer was?

685
00:50:17,158 --> 00:50:18,493
A very nice man.

686
00:50:18,618 --> 00:50:22,205
If that's true, how do you explain
what happened with Lt. Manion's wife?

687
00:50:22,789 --> 00:50:25,500
I don't know what happened
with Lt. Manion's wife...

688
00:50:25,625 --> 00:50:28,169
...so there isn't anything for me to explain.

689
00:50:28,252 --> 00:50:31,339
Your loyalty to the dead Mr. Quill
is very touching.

690
00:50:31,506 --> 00:50:34,300
Barney was well-liked here by everyone,
Mr. Biegler.

691
00:50:34,383 --> 00:50:38,596
It's very generous to overlook his little
faults, like raping other men's wives.

692
00:50:40,097 --> 00:50:41,933
If you will pardon me.

693
00:50:42,016 --> 00:50:44,727
The waitress will take your order
when you're ready.

694
00:50:44,852 --> 00:50:49,232
Nice to have met you,
Mr. Biegler, Mr. McCarthy, Mrs. Rutledge.

695
00:50:51,609 --> 00:50:54,111
You've just been ginned, Lieutenant.

696
00:50:57,240 --> 00:50:58,491
Manion?

697
00:51:02,662 --> 00:51:07,166
- Any word, Lieutenant?
- Yeah, this. From Washington.

698
00:51:07,583 --> 00:51:10,836
They'll let a doctor come to testify,
but there's a string on it.

699
00:51:10,962 --> 00:51:14,715
They want me to go to an army hospital
in Detroit for an examination.

700
00:51:14,799 --> 00:51:18,260
Doesn't the Army understand
you're in jail on a non-bailable offence?

701
00:51:18,344 --> 00:51:20,638
That's it, as far as the Army's concerned.

702
00:51:20,805 --> 00:51:24,350
I don't know how I can get around this.
I'll try to think of something.

703
00:51:24,433 --> 00:51:26,352
My wife hasn't been here for two days.

704
00:51:26,435 --> 00:51:28,771
- Have you seen her?
- No. Not for a while.

705
00:51:28,854 --> 00:51:32,274
- Where the hell is she?
- You've got other things to worry about.

706
00:51:32,358 --> 00:51:35,194
I'll get in touch with her
and tell her you miss her.

707
00:51:35,277 --> 00:51:37,571
Yeah, you tell her that.

708
00:51:38,406 --> 00:51:40,866
- Thanks, Sulo.
- Okay, Pauly.

709
00:51:44,745 --> 00:51:47,248
I know just how you feel, Lieutenant.

710
00:51:47,373 --> 00:51:51,710
I'd be tearing my hair out, too,
if I had something like that outside.

711
00:51:52,503 --> 00:51:54,839
Something like what outside?

712
00:51:54,922 --> 00:52:00,136
You know what I mean. Something
like that running around on the loose.

713
00:52:05,850 --> 00:52:08,352
Now, what's the big noise, buckos?

714
00:52:09,103 --> 00:52:13,274
It's me, dummy.
I hit my elbow on this lousy iron bar.

715
00:52:13,732 --> 00:52:16,402
You want some rubbing alcohol, maybe?

716
00:52:16,485 --> 00:52:19,113
No, but a little bourbon might help.

717
00:52:20,698 --> 00:52:23,367
Knock it off, buckos!

718
00:52:23,617 --> 00:52:25,911
Let's finish the game, Lieutenant.

719
00:52:56,150 --> 00:53:00,279
Hey, what a crazy lawyer we got!
Hi, Pauly.

720
00:53:00,362 --> 00:53:05,993
That's what they call you, isn't it? Pauly?
That's a crazy name for a crazy lawyer.

721
00:53:14,501 --> 00:53:18,505
- Thanks for letting me sit in, Pie-Eye.
- You're not splitting the scene, man?

722
00:53:18,630 --> 00:53:21,717
- I mean, you're not cutting out?
- No, I'll be back.

723
00:53:40,944 --> 00:53:43,906
Hi, Pauly. Fellas, this is Manny's lawyer.

724
00:53:44,698 --> 00:53:46,950
- Sit down, won't you?
- Sorry, I can't right now.

725
00:53:47,075 --> 00:53:50,329
Mrs. Manion, may I talk to you
for a moment outside?

726
00:53:50,454 --> 00:53:53,999
Mrs. Manion? I thought we dropped
the formalities a long time ago.

727
00:53:54,082 --> 00:53:56,918
We'd better pick them up again.
This is important.

728
00:53:57,002 --> 00:53:59,504
- All right, I'll go with you.
- All right, come on.

729
00:53:59,588 --> 00:54:04,176
- You're coming back, aren't you?
- Sure, what do you think?

730
00:54:13,352 --> 00:54:16,480
- See you later, Pie-Eye.
- Okay.

731
00:54:24,571 --> 00:54:26,281
Did you get my phone message?

732
00:54:26,406 --> 00:54:27,949
Yeah, but I got busy.

733
00:54:28,033 --> 00:54:29,951
Why haven't you been to see
your husband?

734
00:54:30,035 --> 00:54:31,995
I don't see why I have to go every day.

735
00:54:32,078 --> 00:54:34,456
It would be a very good idea if you did.

736
00:54:34,539 --> 00:54:36,750
All right. I'll see him every day.

737
00:54:36,875 --> 00:54:38,043
- Okay?
- No, it's not okay.

738
00:54:38,126 --> 00:54:40,045
- Where's your car?
- I came with them.

739
00:54:40,128 --> 00:54:43,340
- Mine's right over here.
- Now wait, I got friends inside.

740
00:54:43,423 --> 00:54:45,217
Friends or not, you're going home.

741
00:54:45,300 --> 00:54:46,384
Who do you think you are?

742
00:54:46,510 --> 00:54:49,387
I'm the lawyer trying to save your husband.
Remember?

743
00:54:49,471 --> 00:54:52,390
- What's that got to do with...
- You listen to me!

744
00:54:52,516 --> 00:54:55,685
Until this is over, you're going to be
a meek little housewife...

745
00:54:55,810 --> 00:54:57,479
...with horn-rimmed spectacles.

746
00:54:57,562 --> 00:55:02,776
You're going to stay away from men,
juke joints, booze and pinball machines.

747
00:55:02,859 --> 00:55:05,528
You're gonna wear a skirt
and low-heeled shoes.

748
00:55:05,612 --> 00:55:08,240
And you're gonna wear a girdle.
Especially a girdle.

749
00:55:08,323 --> 00:55:12,077
Believe me. I don't usually complain
of an attractive jiggle...

750
00:55:12,160 --> 00:55:15,413
...but you save that jiggle
for your husband to look at...

751
00:55:15,497 --> 00:55:19,334
...if and when I get him out of jail.
Now, come on. Let's go.

752
00:55:20,293 --> 00:55:22,003
I'm sorry. I really am.

753
00:55:22,087 --> 00:55:24,506
I wouldn't hurt Manny's chances
for anything.

754
00:55:24,589 --> 00:55:25,840
Come on.

755
00:56:04,504 --> 00:56:06,965
Is this about where
Barney knocked you down?

756
00:56:07,090 --> 00:56:08,800
Yeah. Right over here.

757
00:56:09,008 --> 00:56:11,553
Over there's the opening in the fence
where Muffy...

758
00:56:11,636 --> 00:56:14,556
...was running back and forth
with the flashlight.

759
00:56:16,808 --> 00:56:18,685
Where's your trailer?

760
00:56:19,227 --> 00:56:20,979
Up there on the hill.

761
00:56:27,026 --> 00:56:28,903
This is my favourite place.

762
00:56:33,992 --> 00:56:37,745
Sometimes when Manny was sleeping,
I'd come out here and just sit.

763
00:56:37,912 --> 00:56:39,455
I had to get out of that trailer.

764
00:56:39,539 --> 00:56:42,458
I couldn't stand
being cooped up all the time.

765
00:56:45,670 --> 00:56:48,589
I'm lonely, Paul. I'm awful lonely.

766
00:56:49,507 --> 00:56:53,052
I wouldn't have gone to that roadhouse
if it weren't for that.

767
00:56:53,344 --> 00:56:56,889
Maybe you're getting in
some good practise for being lonely.

768
00:56:57,473 --> 00:56:59,684
You think maybe Manny won't get off?

769
00:56:59,767 --> 00:57:02,895
That'll be up to the jury
and you never can tell about them.

770
00:57:02,979 --> 00:57:05,481
If he didn't, it'd be one way to end it.

771
00:57:06,149 --> 00:57:07,817
No, I don't mean that.

772
00:57:08,568 --> 00:57:12,113
I may think it sometimes,
but I don't really want it.

773
00:57:25,585 --> 00:57:29,964
Hello, sweetie. Did you miss me?
Of course you missed me.

774
00:57:33,259 --> 00:57:37,221
You want to come in, Paul?
You can if you want to, you know.

775
00:57:39,307 --> 00:57:41,183
No, thank you, Laura.

776
00:57:41,726 --> 00:57:45,062
I'm sorry I had to spoil your fun
over at that place.

777
00:57:47,064 --> 00:57:49,775
- Good night, Laura.
- Good night.

778
00:58:18,220 --> 00:58:20,347
Hear ye, hear ye.

779
00:58:20,431 --> 00:58:24,810
The Circuit Court for the County
of Iron Cliffs is now in session.

780
00:58:25,686 --> 00:58:27,188
You can be seated.

781
00:58:32,943 --> 00:58:36,489
For those of you I haven't met,
my name is Weaver.

782
00:58:37,031 --> 00:58:39,658
I'm from downstate
and I'm sitting temporarily...

783
00:58:39,742 --> 00:58:43,913
...while your good Judge Maitland
is recovering from a severe illness.

784
00:58:44,246 --> 00:58:47,458
There's no need, I think,
to dwell at length upon my methods.

785
00:58:47,541 --> 00:58:50,169
One judge is quite like another.

786
00:58:50,252 --> 00:58:54,048
The only differences may be
in the state of their digestions...

787
00:58:54,131 --> 00:58:57,468
...or their proclivities
for sleeping on the bench.

788
00:58:57,635 --> 00:59:00,387
For myself, I can digest pig iron...

789
00:59:00,930 --> 00:59:04,099
...and while I might appear
to doze occasionally, you'll find...

790
00:59:04,183 --> 00:59:06,060
...that I'm easily awakened...

791
00:59:06,143 --> 00:59:09,688
...particularly if shaken gently
by a good lawyer...

792
00:59:09,813 --> 00:59:11,899
...with a nice point of law.

793
00:59:12,983 --> 00:59:15,736
We will now take up the criminal docket.

794
00:59:15,819 --> 00:59:19,490
Case Number 1:
The People versus Clarence Madigan.

795
00:59:20,032 --> 00:59:22,534
Breaking and entering in the nighttime.

796
00:59:23,035 --> 00:59:25,913
Will the defendant rise and come forward?

797
00:59:26,038 --> 00:59:27,998
That's me, Your Honour.

798
00:59:36,382 --> 00:59:40,552
"State of Michigan, Court of Iron Cliffs.
I, Mitch Lodwick, prosecuting attorney...

799
00:59:40,677 --> 00:59:43,764
"... come into said county
and give the court to understand...

800
00:59:43,931 --> 00:59:49,144
"... that Clarence Madigan, alias 'One-Shot
Madigan,' alias 'Smoky Madigan'...

801
00:59:49,228 --> 00:59:51,438
"... did enter the dwelling of Casper Katz...

802
00:59:51,563 --> 00:59:55,317
"... and did there commit the felony
of larceny on said premises."

803
00:59:56,026 --> 00:59:58,445
Does Mr. Madigan have an attorney?

804
00:59:58,529 --> 01:00:02,324
No. A man's got to have money
to ask them fellows the time of day.

805
01:00:02,574 --> 01:00:06,370
Mr. Madigan, if you're impoverished,
it's my duty to appoint an attorney...

806
01:00:06,453 --> 01:00:07,788
...on your behalf.

807
01:00:07,871 --> 01:00:12,960
I wouldn't bother, Your Honour.
I stole the whiskey. I'm guilty as hell.

808
01:00:13,335 --> 01:00:15,796
It was a full case of expensive bourbon.

809
01:00:15,921 --> 01:00:17,339
Did you sell this whiskey?

810
01:00:17,548 --> 01:00:19,049
No. I drank it.

811
01:00:19,132 --> 01:00:20,926
- All of it?
- You bet, Judge.

812
01:00:21,009 --> 01:00:24,721
Are you aware that it will be necessary
to punish you for this crime?

813
01:00:24,846 --> 01:00:26,265
It was worth it.

814
01:00:26,431 --> 01:00:30,519
I'll accept your plea of guilty.
You'll be sentenced later.

815
01:00:30,727 --> 01:00:33,897
- You may now return to your place.
- Thanks, Your Honour.

816
01:00:35,983 --> 01:00:37,651
Case Number 2:

817
01:00:38,485 --> 01:00:42,656
The People versus Frederick Manion.
The charge: Murder.

818
01:00:43,156 --> 01:00:47,744
Paul Biegler for the defendant.
My formal appearance is already on file.

819
01:00:47,911 --> 01:00:50,622
Which of these men is your client,
Mr. Biegler?

820
01:00:50,706 --> 01:00:52,082
None of them.

821
01:00:52,165 --> 01:00:55,168
Mr. Sheriff, will you produce the prisoner?

822
01:00:55,669 --> 01:00:58,380
I'm afraid I can't do that, Your Honour.

823
01:00:59,589 --> 01:01:02,509
Perhaps someone should explain.
I'm not clairvoyant.

824
01:01:02,843 --> 01:01:06,847
The defendant is in Detroit
being examined by a psychiatrist.

825
01:01:06,972 --> 01:01:09,015
Shouldn't the court have been consulted...

826
01:01:09,099 --> 01:01:12,185
...before the defendant
was allowed to leave its jurisdiction?

827
01:01:12,269 --> 01:01:14,980
We're dealing with the Army in this matter.

828
01:01:15,105 --> 01:01:18,316
They only gave us one crack
at one of their psychiatrists.

829
01:01:18,400 --> 01:01:20,569
The court was not present
and it was urgent...

830
01:01:20,694 --> 01:01:23,155
...to get the defendant to the psychiatrist.

831
01:01:23,280 --> 01:01:25,657
What does the attorney for the People say?

832
01:01:25,740 --> 01:01:27,868
It was done with my knowledge,
Your Honour.

833
01:01:27,951 --> 01:01:30,829
I've always heard this Upper Peninsula
of our fair state...

834
01:01:30,912 --> 01:01:32,581
...was a queer place.

835
01:01:32,664 --> 01:01:36,376
If it's customary here to allow a man
charged with first-degree murder...

836
01:01:36,459 --> 01:01:40,422
...to wander about at will,
I don't suppose it behoves an outsider...

837
01:01:40,505 --> 01:01:45,260
...to point out that the law makes
no provision for such quaint liberalism.

838
01:01:45,594 --> 01:01:50,223
The defendant is in the care of a deputy
and will be returned this afternoon.

839
01:01:50,307 --> 01:01:53,643
We'll formally arraign the defendant
on his return.

840
01:01:54,269 --> 01:01:57,522
For the sake of the docket,
can you give me a clue as to his plea?

841
01:01:57,772 --> 01:02:01,067
The defendant will waive reading
of the information and stand mute.

842
01:02:01,151 --> 01:02:03,361
A plea of not guilty will be entered.

843
01:02:03,528 --> 01:02:07,490
The case of Frederick Manion
will be placed first on the trial docket.

844
01:02:18,918 --> 01:02:20,086
Can you hurry it up?

845
01:02:20,170 --> 01:02:23,757
If the judge hears the prisoner
was lounging at the railroad station...

846
01:02:23,882 --> 01:02:25,341
...he'll really give it to me.

847
01:02:25,425 --> 01:02:28,136
It'll just take a minute. Come over here.

848
01:02:32,015 --> 01:02:34,142
Lieutenant, how did things turn out?

849
01:02:34,851 --> 01:02:36,352
I was temporarily insane.

850
01:02:36,436 --> 01:02:38,104
- Did he tell you that?
- Yeah.

851
01:02:38,688 --> 01:02:43,443
He said he'd write you a letter,
but I took notes on my own.

852
01:02:43,568 --> 01:02:45,778
- The doctor's name was Smith.
- Smith?

853
01:02:45,862 --> 01:02:50,116
Anatole Ludwig Smith
or Ludwig von Smith, I hope.

854
01:02:50,200 --> 01:02:53,494
- Name like that would impress the jury.
- Just plain Matthew Smith.

855
01:02:53,578 --> 01:02:55,580
He said when I shot Quill...

856
01:02:55,663 --> 01:02:58,374
...I was suffering from
"dissociative reaction."

857
01:02:58,625 --> 01:03:02,170
Dissociative reaction.
Sounds pretty good, doesn't it, Parn?

858
01:03:02,462 --> 01:03:04,005
What does it mean in English?

859
01:03:04,088 --> 01:03:08,468
It means I had an "irresistible impulse"
to shoot Quill.

860
01:03:11,429 --> 01:03:12,889
That's okay, isn't it?

861
01:03:13,097 --> 01:03:15,058
Did he say you knew the difference...

862
01:03:15,141 --> 01:03:17,602
...between right and wrong
when you shot Quill?

863
01:03:17,727 --> 01:03:21,064
I don't think he said anything about that.
Is that important?

864
01:03:21,773 --> 01:03:24,901
We'd better not keep the sheriff waiting.
You'd better go.

865
01:03:43,544 --> 01:03:47,882
You ever heard of a Michigan court
accepting irresistible impulse as insanity?

866
01:03:47,965 --> 01:03:50,968
No. Maybe we'd better switch
to self-defence.

867
01:03:51,427 --> 01:03:54,764
Even Mitch Lodwick
would make a monkey out of us on that.

868
01:03:54,847 --> 01:03:56,307
Damn strawberry soda.

869
01:03:56,390 --> 01:03:58,893
- Here, do you want a peanut?
- No, thanks.

870
01:03:59,602 --> 01:04:01,479
Tomorrow is Saturday.

871
01:04:01,896 --> 01:04:04,357
We just have the weekend before the trial.

872
01:04:04,440 --> 01:04:06,108
When do we start working?

873
01:04:06,192 --> 01:04:08,569
Tomorrow morning. Early.

874
01:05:04,125 --> 01:05:06,418
- Pauly!
- Hey, listen to this, Parn.

875
01:05:06,627 --> 01:05:08,712
Never mind that. Just find:

876
01:05:09,922 --> 01:05:15,177
"People versus Durfee,
62, Michigan, 486, year 1886."

877
01:05:15,302 --> 01:05:18,430
<i>That's it. I have it right here in the A.L.R.
Listen.</i>

878
01:05:18,722 --> 01:05:21,600
"The right and wrong test,
though deemed unscientific...

879
01:05:21,684 --> 01:05:25,104
"... is adhered to by most of the states,
but..." Listen to this.

880
01:05:25,187 --> 01:05:28,148
"But, the fact that one accused
of committing a crime...

881
01:05:28,232 --> 01:05:30,860
"... may have been able
to comprehend the nature...

882
01:05:30,943 --> 01:05:33,028
"... and the consequences of this act...

883
01:05:33,112 --> 01:05:36,490
"... and to know that it was wrong,
nevertheless..."

884
01:05:36,615 --> 01:05:39,326
Dear, sweet, endearing word,
"nevertheless."

885
01:05:39,577 --> 01:05:44,373
"Nevertheless, if he was forced
to its execution by an impulse...

886
01:05:44,999 --> 01:05:48,002
"... by an impulse,
which he was powerless to control...

887
01:05:48,127 --> 01:05:50,462
"... he will be excused from punishment."

888
01:05:50,754 --> 01:05:54,383
Why, the Michigan Supreme Court
did accept irresistible impulse, Parn.

889
01:05:54,466 --> 01:05:56,176
This is precedent.

890
01:05:56,260 --> 01:05:58,429
I think we got a hold of something here.

891
01:05:58,512 --> 01:06:02,891
Good old Durfee, 1886. How about that?
Give me a pad.

892
01:06:04,268 --> 01:06:08,063
By the saints, this strawberry soda pop
is beginning to taste like whiskey.

893
01:06:08,147 --> 01:06:11,567
Don't get drunk yet.
We've got to convince a jury...

894
01:06:11,734 --> 01:06:14,778
...that our client was irresistibly impulsed.

895
01:06:14,862 --> 01:06:16,155
Remember that.

896
01:06:17,406 --> 01:06:19,700
Ladies and gentlemen of the jury.

897
01:06:20,075 --> 01:06:23,787
Before we proceed, it will be necessary
for me to examine you...

898
01:06:23,871 --> 01:06:27,166
...on your qualifications to sit as jurors.

899
01:06:27,916 --> 01:06:30,377
Please remember that you are under oath.

900
01:06:30,461 --> 01:06:32,337
Are all of you citizens?

901
01:06:32,880 --> 01:06:35,716
Will you please raise your hand
if you are not?

902
01:06:48,395 --> 01:06:53,275
Are there any justices of the peace
or law enforcement officers among you?

903
01:06:53,650 --> 01:06:54,735
No.

904
01:06:55,861 --> 01:07:00,616
Are any of you related by blood
or marriage to a law enforcement officer?

905
01:07:01,074 --> 01:07:02,367
No.

906
01:07:02,576 --> 01:07:06,330
So much for qualifications.
I will now examine for cause.

907
01:07:06,705 --> 01:07:11,418
Does anyone have business pending with
the prosecuting attorney, Mitch Lodwick?

908
01:07:11,501 --> 01:07:12,753
No.

909
01:07:13,086 --> 01:07:18,133
Does anyone have business pending
with Paul Biegler, attorney for the defence?

910
01:07:18,425 --> 01:07:19,634
No.

911
01:07:20,052 --> 01:07:22,095
Is anyone acquainted with the defendant...

912
01:07:22,179 --> 01:07:24,556
...seated there on Mr. Biegler's left?

913
01:07:29,102 --> 01:07:31,188
Will the defendant's wife please stand?

914
01:07:31,271 --> 01:07:34,399
- Do any of you know Mrs. Manion?
- No.

915
01:07:34,483 --> 01:07:37,277
Thank you, Mrs. Manion.
You may be seated.

916
01:07:38,403 --> 01:07:40,655
Counsel may challenge the jury for cause.

917
01:07:40,864 --> 01:07:45,827
Before counsel's challenge, may I introduce
Mr. Claude Dancer to the court?

918
01:07:46,369 --> 01:07:49,414
Mr. Dancer is an assistant attorney general
from Lansing.

919
01:07:49,539 --> 01:07:52,209
Because of the peculiar nature
of this case...

920
01:07:52,292 --> 01:07:56,213
...I asked the attorney general
for Mr. Dancer to sit with the prosecution.

921
01:07:56,546 --> 01:07:58,798
Your reputation precedes you, Mr. Dancer.

922
01:07:58,965 --> 01:08:03,136
- It's a privilege to have you in my court.
- I'm sure it'll be instructive.

923
01:08:04,429 --> 01:08:09,309
Do any of you have any business pending
before the attorney general's office?

924
01:08:09,517 --> 01:08:11,102
No.

925
01:08:11,978 --> 01:08:14,898
I must apologise
for my disparaging remarks...

926
01:08:14,981 --> 01:08:17,567
...about the Upper Peninsula
and its customs.

927
01:08:17,692 --> 01:08:22,739
I've seldom seen a murder jury selected
and sworn in less than half a day.

928
01:08:23,198 --> 01:08:26,201
You've won my heart completely.

929
01:08:26,284 --> 01:08:29,663
Mr. Dancer, you asked for the recess.
What's your problem?

930
01:08:29,829 --> 01:08:32,499
There was a little suggestion
I wanted to make.

931
01:08:32,624 --> 01:08:33,958
By all means.

932
01:08:34,042 --> 01:08:38,755
Since the defence plea is insanity,
the prosecution has retained a psychiatrist.

933
01:08:38,963 --> 01:08:43,551
By statute, we have the right to request
a mental examination by our own doctor.

934
01:08:43,635 --> 01:08:46,054
Are you familiar with that statute,
Mr. Biegler?

935
01:08:47,055 --> 01:08:48,181
Moderately.

936
01:08:48,264 --> 01:08:51,059
It would only delay things
to file a formal petition...

937
01:08:51,184 --> 01:08:54,396
...so why don't we informally agree...

938
01:08:54,521 --> 01:08:57,273
...to ask for an adjournment?
Only a day or so...

939
01:08:57,399 --> 01:09:01,277
...and our doctor can see the defendant.
It would save a great deal of time.

940
01:09:01,402 --> 01:09:03,279
- Yes, I'm sure it will.
- Good.

941
01:09:03,404 --> 01:09:07,742
But, suppose you just go ahead
and file that formal petition anyway?

942
01:09:08,368 --> 01:09:12,122
You're a little late,
but maybe His Honour will overlook that.

943
01:09:12,330 --> 01:09:17,335
I'd sort of like the jury to see that
you think our insanity plea has some merit.

944
01:09:17,460 --> 01:09:20,046
There's no need for our doctor
to examine your client.

945
01:09:20,171 --> 01:09:23,550
- I was only following the usual procedure.
- I'm all for it.

946
01:09:24,133 --> 01:09:25,802
Do you wish to file the petition?

947
01:09:26,553 --> 01:09:28,263
- Yes...
- It won't be necessary.

948
01:09:28,471 --> 01:09:30,014
It won't be necessary.

949
01:09:30,265 --> 01:09:33,935
Skirmish over.
Shall we join now on the field of battle?

950
01:09:37,730 --> 01:09:41,526
The body of Quill had sustained
five gunshot wounds.

951
01:09:42,110 --> 01:09:45,029
One of the bullets
had passed through the heart.

952
01:09:45,113 --> 01:09:48,449
Death, in my opinion,
was almost instantaneous...

953
01:09:48,533 --> 01:09:50,785
...and was directly caused by this wound.

954
01:09:50,868 --> 01:09:53,830
Dr. Raschid,
may I have your detailed report?

955
01:09:53,913 --> 01:09:55,164
Certainly.

956
01:09:55,248 --> 01:09:59,002
I ask that this report be marked
"People's Exhibit 1" for identification.

957
01:09:59,085 --> 01:10:00,920
So received and marked.

958
01:10:01,337 --> 01:10:04,507
The People hand the defence
a copy of the report.

959
01:10:04,674 --> 01:10:06,718
Counsel may cross-examine.

960
01:10:06,801 --> 01:10:11,639
Dr. Raschid, your primary purpose was
to ascertain the cause of death, was it not?

961
01:10:11,723 --> 01:10:12,890
Yes.

962
01:10:12,974 --> 01:10:14,851
Yet I read in your report...

963
01:10:14,976 --> 01:10:18,771
...you checked to determine
if spermatogenesis was occurring...

964
01:10:18,896 --> 01:10:21,107
...in the body at the time of death.

965
01:10:21,190 --> 01:10:22,567
Objection, Your Honour!

966
01:10:22,650 --> 01:10:25,736
The People call this witness
only to show the cause of death.

967
01:10:25,862 --> 01:10:28,739
Your Honour,
the entire report was offered as evidence...

968
01:10:28,823 --> 01:10:31,701
...and it contains this information
about spermatogenesis.

969
01:10:31,826 --> 01:10:34,745
Overruled, Mr. Lodwick.
The witness may answer.

970
01:10:35,663 --> 01:10:38,457
Yes, I made that examination
on the deceased.

971
01:10:38,708 --> 01:10:41,127
Would you tell the court your findings?

972
01:10:41,878 --> 01:10:44,589
Spermatogenesis was occurring
at the time of death.

973
01:10:45,089 --> 01:10:48,259
In other words, the deceased,
in life, was not sterile.

974
01:10:48,676 --> 01:10:50,678
- He could produce children.
- Correct.

975
01:10:50,761 --> 01:10:55,099
If a woman says she has had intercourse
with a certain man...

976
01:10:56,017 --> 01:11:00,021
...who is proven fertile, though no evidence
is found in the woman's body...

977
01:11:00,104 --> 01:11:02,481
...could a lawyer, a prosecuting attorney...

978
01:11:02,565 --> 01:11:05,943
...could he use this as evidence
that the woman is lying?

979
01:11:06,027 --> 01:11:07,236
Your Honour...

980
01:11:07,361 --> 01:11:10,531
...I object to this line of questioning.

981
01:11:10,740 --> 01:11:15,369
We are not concerned here with relations
between a man and a woman.

982
01:11:15,453 --> 01:11:18,706
As long as an examination
for spermatogenesis had been made...

983
01:11:18,831 --> 01:11:20,833
...at least we're entitled to know why.

984
01:11:20,916 --> 01:11:22,501
Overruled. You may answer.

985
01:11:22,877 --> 01:11:25,588
Yes, prosecution could use that...

986
01:11:25,713 --> 01:11:29,091
...though it certainly would not be
conclusive that she was lying.

987
01:11:29,383 --> 01:11:30,468
Why not?

988
01:11:30,551 --> 01:11:33,929
There could be several reasons
why the test on her was negative.

989
01:11:34,180 --> 01:11:36,891
The use of a contraceptive...

990
01:11:37,183 --> 01:11:40,895
...or possibly, there was no completion
on the part of the man.

991
01:11:41,228 --> 01:11:43,814
In this post-mortem,
were you asked to determine...

992
01:11:43,898 --> 01:11:46,525
...if the deceased
had reached sexual climax...

993
01:11:46,609 --> 01:11:48,819
...shortly before death?
- No, sir.

994
01:11:48,944 --> 01:11:51,655
- Could you have determined it?
- Yes.

995
01:11:52,448 --> 01:11:55,326
So, you were only asked
to make such examinations...

996
01:11:55,451 --> 01:11:58,579
...that might be useful to the prosecution,
but not the defence?

997
01:11:58,662 --> 01:12:00,122
I object, Your Honour.

998
01:12:00,664 --> 01:12:02,333
The question is argumentative.

999
01:12:02,416 --> 01:12:06,879
The defence is trying to impugn the intent
of the representatives of the People.

1000
01:12:06,962 --> 01:12:10,174
Mr. Biegler, you must be aware
that the question is improper.

1001
01:12:10,257 --> 01:12:12,843
I withdraw the question and apologise.

1002
01:12:13,052 --> 01:12:15,304
The question and answer will be stricken...

1003
01:12:15,471 --> 01:12:19,058
...and the jury will disregard
both the question and the answer.

1004
01:12:20,017 --> 01:12:21,185
That's all.

1005
01:12:21,477 --> 01:12:25,522
No redirect.
The People now call Lloyd Burke.

1006
01:12:26,315 --> 01:12:28,734
Will the witness step forward, please?

1007
01:12:32,363 --> 01:12:35,783
How can a jury disregard
what it has already heard?

1008
01:12:36,533 --> 01:12:38,661
They can't, Lieutenant.

1009
01:12:39,411 --> 01:12:40,662
They can't.

1010
01:12:41,747 --> 01:12:44,249
...the whole truth and nothing
but the truth, so help you God?

1011
01:12:44,333 --> 01:12:45,376
I do.

1012
01:12:47,252 --> 01:12:49,505
Will you state your profession, please?

1013
01:12:49,630 --> 01:12:51,298
I'm a commercial photographer.

1014
01:12:51,507 --> 01:12:53,967
Were you called upon by the police...

1015
01:12:54,051 --> 01:12:57,846
...to take photographs of the body
of the deceased, Bernard Quill...

1016
01:12:57,930 --> 01:13:00,974
...before and after he was removed
from the scene of death?

1017
01:13:01,058 --> 01:13:02,142
Yes, sir.

1018
01:13:02,226 --> 01:13:05,145
Were these photographs of the deceased
made by you?

1019
01:13:09,817 --> 01:13:11,193
They were.

1020
01:13:11,401 --> 01:13:13,362
The recorder will mark these photographs:

1021
01:13:13,445 --> 01:13:16,406
"People's Exhibit 2A to 2D"
for identification.

1022
01:13:16,657 --> 01:13:19,952
Photographs are tendered to the defence
for examination...

1023
01:13:20,160 --> 01:13:22,955
...and we move their admission
as evidence. Your witness.

1024
01:13:23,247 --> 01:13:24,831
No questions, no objections.

1025
01:13:24,915 --> 01:13:28,919
- He took pictures of me that night, too.
- Just a minute, Mr. Burke.

1026
01:13:32,130 --> 01:13:35,092
Mr. Burke, these photographs
offered as evidence:

1027
01:13:35,175 --> 01:13:37,928
Are they the only photographs
you took that night?

1028
01:13:38,887 --> 01:13:40,138
No.

1029
01:13:40,347 --> 01:13:42,266
The others didn't turn out?

1030
01:13:43,141 --> 01:13:45,060
All my pictures turn out.

1031
01:13:45,268 --> 01:13:48,397
Of course. I beg your pardon.

1032
01:13:48,563 --> 01:13:50,899
Did you give the other pictures
to the police?

1033
01:13:51,066 --> 01:13:52,359
Yes, sir, I did.

1034
01:13:52,651 --> 01:13:53,694
What were they?

1035
01:13:53,860 --> 01:13:57,572
Were they side shots
or a shot of the moon, perhaps?

1036
01:13:57,656 --> 01:14:00,367
Or a black bear scavenging
in the Thunder Bay dump?

1037
01:14:00,450 --> 01:14:04,496
I object. I can't see how other photographs
are relevant.

1038
01:14:04,579 --> 01:14:06,790
The photographs
were introduced to show...

1039
01:14:06,873 --> 01:14:09,334
...that the deceased
met with a violent death.

1040
01:14:09,584 --> 01:14:13,004
Your Honour, any photograph
pertaining to the case would be relevant.

1041
01:14:13,296 --> 01:14:15,799
The point is good, Mr. Biegler. Continue.

1042
01:14:16,007 --> 01:14:18,802
What were these other photographs of,
Mr. Burke?

1043
01:14:19,719 --> 01:14:21,346
Lt. Manion's wife.

1044
01:14:21,513 --> 01:14:25,267
These photographs showed how she looked
after Barney Quill was killed?

1045
01:14:25,517 --> 01:14:28,436
- Yes.
- Your Honour, how she looked is irrelevant.

1046
01:14:28,603 --> 01:14:32,149
No evidence has been introduced
to connect her appearance to the murder.

1047
01:14:32,232 --> 01:14:34,776
- Sustained.
- I'm sorry, Your Honour.

1048
01:14:34,860 --> 01:14:38,113
I wanted to be sure the prosecution
wasn't withholding evidence.

1049
01:14:38,196 --> 01:14:39,489
Now, look here!

1050
01:14:39,698 --> 01:14:42,742
I protest to the defence attorney's
persistent attacks...

1051
01:14:42,868 --> 01:14:45,161
...on the motives of the prosecution.

1052
01:14:45,287 --> 01:14:49,874
The jury will disregard the remark made
by the attorney for the defence.

1053
01:14:50,250 --> 01:14:54,504
There is no reason to believe
the prosecution hasn't acted in good faith.

1054
01:14:54,671 --> 01:14:57,674
My apologies to the prosecution
and the court.

1055
01:14:57,757 --> 01:14:59,175
But, Your Honour...

1056
01:14:59,342 --> 01:15:03,763
...as long as protests are being made,
I'd like to make a protest myself.

1057
01:15:03,972 --> 01:15:09,144
I'm perfectly willing to take on
these two legal giants any time, any place.

1058
01:15:09,477 --> 01:15:11,980
But, in all fairness,
it ought to be one at a time.

1059
01:15:12,063 --> 01:15:15,734
I don't want these two pitching
knuckle balls at me at the same time.

1060
01:15:16,192 --> 01:15:19,154
It seems to me
you're batting close to 1000...

1061
01:15:19,279 --> 01:15:21,698
...but your point is well-taken.

1062
01:15:21,948 --> 01:15:24,367
Whichever attorney opens
with the witness...

1063
01:15:24,617 --> 01:15:29,122
...he, alone, shall continue
with that witness until they are excused.

1064
01:15:29,247 --> 01:15:31,499
Thank you, Your Honour.
No more questions.

1065
01:15:31,750 --> 01:15:33,126
No questions.

1066
01:15:44,137 --> 01:15:45,722
We're doing well, aren't we?

1067
01:15:45,805 --> 01:15:49,017
- Where is Parnell?
- Why? Isn't he here?

1068
01:15:49,142 --> 01:15:52,353
No, nor in his rooming house.
He hasn't been there all night.

1069
01:15:52,437 --> 01:15:54,147
You saw him last. Where is he?

1070
01:15:54,230 --> 01:15:56,482
I promised not to tell, so don't ask me.

1071
01:15:56,566 --> 01:15:58,693
He hasn't fallen off the wagon?

1072
01:15:58,818 --> 01:16:00,028
No. He was sober.

1073
01:16:00,111 --> 01:16:01,404
Has he gone somewhere?

1074
01:16:01,487 --> 01:16:03,781
He did borrow my car for something.

1075
01:16:03,865 --> 01:16:05,658
Your car? That was smart.

1076
01:16:05,742 --> 01:16:09,329
He hasn't driven a car in 20 years.
He'll kill himself. Where's he gone?

1077
01:16:09,454 --> 01:16:11,247
My word is my bond.

1078
01:16:37,148 --> 01:16:39,067
Good morning, ladies and gentlemen.

1079
01:16:39,359 --> 01:16:40,401
You may proceed.

1080
01:16:41,152 --> 01:16:42,737
Your Honour...

1081
01:16:43,237 --> 01:16:46,991
...the defence notices a third person
at the prosecution's table.

1082
01:16:47,075 --> 01:16:50,203
We were wondering if the court
shares our curiosity about him?

1083
01:16:50,286 --> 01:16:51,913
I was about to introduce him.

1084
01:16:52,246 --> 01:16:55,958
Your Honour, this gentleman
is Dr. W. Gregory Harcourt.

1085
01:16:56,751 --> 01:17:00,004
Dr. Harcourt is the People's psychiatrist
in this case.

1086
01:17:00,588 --> 01:17:04,967
We ask that Dr. Harcourt be allowed
to sit at our table as an observer.

1087
01:17:05,134 --> 01:17:10,014
What will he observe? The constellation
of Taurus or the life of a bumblebee?

1088
01:17:10,389 --> 01:17:12,266
He'll observe the defendant.

1089
01:17:13,434 --> 01:17:14,810
That's fine.

1090
01:17:14,894 --> 01:17:16,646
The defence has no objection.

1091
01:17:16,729 --> 01:17:19,398
I just wish to express my relief...

1092
01:17:19,565 --> 01:17:23,611
...that the new recruit is not additional
legal reinforcements from Lansing.

1093
01:17:24,028 --> 01:17:26,280
We call Alphonse Paquette.

1094
01:17:32,662 --> 01:17:34,372
Raise your right hand, please.

1095
01:17:34,455 --> 01:17:37,166
You do solemnly swear
that the testimony you give...

1096
01:17:37,250 --> 01:17:41,045
...shall be the truth, the whole truth
and nothing but the truth?

1097
01:17:41,170 --> 01:17:42,922
- I do.
- Take the seat, please.

1098
01:17:45,675 --> 01:17:47,510
Will you state your name, please?

1099
01:17:47,593 --> 01:17:49,178
Alphonse Paquette.

1100
01:17:49,261 --> 01:17:53,182
- You work at the Thunder Bay Inn, right?
- I'm bartender there.

1101
01:17:53,432 --> 01:17:56,811
Were you working the night
Mr. Quill was shot by Frederick Manion?

1102
01:17:56,894 --> 01:17:59,146
- I was.
- Were you witness to the shooting?

1103
01:17:59,355 --> 01:18:00,439
I was.

1104
01:18:00,523 --> 01:18:03,526
Will you tell us in your own words, please,
what happened?

1105
01:18:04,610 --> 01:18:07,988
I was at a table by the door
when Lt. Manion came in.

1106
01:18:08,072 --> 01:18:10,199
Did you know Lt. Manion
by sight and name?

1107
01:18:10,408 --> 01:18:11,826
- Yes, sir.
- Go ahead.

1108
01:18:13,035 --> 01:18:16,789
He came in and walked over to the bar
and began to shoot.

1109
01:18:17,790 --> 01:18:20,251
He shot Barney
when he came up to the bar.

1110
01:18:20,417 --> 01:18:24,130
When Barney fell, he kept on shooting
down at Barney behind the bar.

1111
01:18:24,338 --> 01:18:25,965
Then he turned and walked out.

1112
01:18:26,048 --> 01:18:30,427
When Lt. Manion entered the bar,
how did he appear to you?

1113
01:18:30,678 --> 01:18:32,555
Well, he walked slow.

1114
01:18:33,097 --> 01:18:35,307
Kind of deliberate.

1115
01:18:35,391 --> 01:18:37,351
Did he speak to Barney Quill?

1116
01:18:37,434 --> 01:18:38,602
Not a word.

1117
01:18:39,061 --> 01:18:42,064
He just walked over
and pulled out his gun and "bang."

1118
01:18:42,648 --> 01:18:44,900
- And then he walked out?
- Yes.

1119
01:18:45,734 --> 01:18:48,571
When he walked out,
how did he appear to you?

1120
01:18:49,071 --> 01:18:51,448
He seemed just like he did
when he walked in.

1121
01:18:51,574 --> 01:18:53,784
Like he was the mailman delivering mail.

1122
01:18:54,201 --> 01:18:57,204
When Lt. Manion walked out of the bar,
what did you do?

1123
01:18:57,329 --> 01:19:00,582
It happened so fast,
I guess I was stunned...

1124
01:19:00,916 --> 01:19:03,585
...but then I ran after him.
- Did you find him outside?

1125
01:19:03,752 --> 01:19:06,463
- Yes, sir. He was walking away.
- Did you speak to him?

1126
01:19:06,588 --> 01:19:10,759
I said, "Lieutenant,
you'd better not run away from this."

1127
01:19:10,884 --> 01:19:12,720
Did he reply to you?

1128
01:19:13,345 --> 01:19:16,265
He said, "Do you want some, too, buster?"

1129
01:19:16,974 --> 01:19:18,892
Was he pointing the gun at you?

1130
01:19:18,976 --> 01:19:22,855
He was holding the gun in my direction,
but the muzzle was low.

1131
01:19:23,147 --> 01:19:27,109
When he said,
"Do you want some, too, buster?"...

1132
01:19:27,234 --> 01:19:28,736
...how was that expressed?

1133
01:19:28,819 --> 01:19:33,991
Did he shout it? Was it hysterical?
Was he hoarse? Did his voice tremble?

1134
01:19:34,825 --> 01:19:38,912
No, sir. He just said it cool and hard,
and looked right at me.

1135
01:19:39,288 --> 01:19:42,291
Did he appear to you,
as far as you could tell...

1136
01:19:42,416 --> 01:19:45,294
...to be in complete possession
of his faculties?

1137
01:19:45,711 --> 01:19:48,046
Yes, sir, as far as I could tell.

1138
01:19:48,630 --> 01:19:51,550
- Your witness.
- Did you see Laura Manion...

1139
01:19:51,675 --> 01:19:53,927
...Lt. Manion's wife, in the bar that night?

1140
01:19:54,011 --> 01:19:57,139
There he goes again.
This is immaterial and irrelevant.

1141
01:19:57,222 --> 01:20:01,185
I don't see what the prosecution's
jumpy about. I haven't gone any place yet.

1142
01:20:01,476 --> 01:20:04,897
Let's see where he's going
before we start objecting, Mr. Lodwick.

1143
01:20:05,063 --> 01:20:07,065
You may proceed, Mr. Biegler.

1144
01:20:07,316 --> 01:20:10,027
Did you see Mrs. Manion
in the bar that night?

1145
01:20:10,193 --> 01:20:13,780
- She was there.
- Did Barney Quill leave the bar that night?

1146
01:20:14,448 --> 01:20:16,533
- Yes.
- Do you remember when he returned?

1147
01:20:16,783 --> 01:20:18,452
Around midnight.

1148
01:20:18,910 --> 01:20:20,662
From which entrance did he come?

1149
01:20:20,746 --> 01:20:24,916
Did he come from the lobby entrance
or from that outside entrance?

1150
01:20:25,042 --> 01:20:26,710
It was from the lobby.

1151
01:20:27,252 --> 01:20:30,213
- How did he appear to you at that time?
- How do you mean?

1152
01:20:30,756 --> 01:20:32,674
You understood the prosecution...

1153
01:20:32,758 --> 01:20:35,469
...when he asked
about Lt. Manion's appearance.

1154
01:20:35,969 --> 01:20:38,764
He was just old Barney, like usual.

1155
01:20:39,139 --> 01:20:43,310
You mean,
he was just good old, sober, reliable...

1156
01:20:43,435 --> 01:20:47,439
...gentle, salt-of-the-earth,
friend-to-man Barney?

1157
01:20:47,522 --> 01:20:51,193
- What kind of a question is that?
- I withdraw the question.

1158
01:20:53,070 --> 01:20:54,821
Mr. Paquette...

1159
01:20:55,113 --> 01:20:58,909
...had Barney changed his clothes
since he left the bar?

1160
01:20:59,117 --> 01:21:00,160
I don't remember.

1161
01:21:00,285 --> 01:21:03,038
Might his clothing have been different
when he returned?

1162
01:21:03,121 --> 01:21:05,832
That is,
might he have changed his clothes?

1163
01:21:06,291 --> 01:21:07,876
I couldn't say. I didn't notice.

1164
01:21:08,168 --> 01:21:09,961
Was Barney drinking that night?

1165
01:21:11,838 --> 01:21:14,674
He always had a few shots
while talking to the customers.

1166
01:21:14,758 --> 01:21:18,053
- He was friendly.
- Sure he was, good old Barney.

1167
01:21:18,178 --> 01:21:21,890
How many shots would you say
good old Barney usually had?

1168
01:21:22,140 --> 01:21:23,225
I don't know exactly.

1169
01:21:23,308 --> 01:21:26,353
Wasn't he, in fact,
pretty loaded that night?

1170
01:21:26,436 --> 01:21:27,771
Objection.

1171
01:21:27,854 --> 01:21:31,441
Even if the deceased was dead drunk,
it's no defence to this charge.

1172
01:21:31,733 --> 01:21:34,861
Sustained. I suggest you get off this.

1173
01:21:35,362 --> 01:21:36,696
Mr. Paquette.

1174
01:21:36,863 --> 01:21:40,533
What would you call a man
with an insatiable penchant for women?

1175
01:21:41,368 --> 01:21:42,494
A what?

1176
01:21:42,953 --> 01:21:46,289
A penchant: A desire, a taste, passion.

1177
01:21:47,624 --> 01:21:49,292
A ladies' man, I guess.

1178
01:21:49,376 --> 01:21:51,628
Or maybe just a damned fool.

1179
01:21:53,129 --> 01:21:56,007
Just answer the questions, Mr. Paquette.

1180
01:21:56,341 --> 01:21:58,885
The attorneys will provide the wisecracks.

1181
01:22:00,553 --> 01:22:02,931
What else would you call a man like that?

1182
01:22:03,014 --> 01:22:05,183
We can't see the drift of this.

1183
01:22:05,266 --> 01:22:07,310
You mean you do see, Mr. Lodwick.

1184
01:22:07,519 --> 01:22:08,561
You may answer.

1185
01:22:09,020 --> 01:22:11,022
Can you think of another name?

1186
01:22:11,856 --> 01:22:13,858
- Woman chaser.
- Try again.

1187
01:22:14,776 --> 01:22:17,529
- Masher?
- Come now, Mr. Paquette.

1188
01:22:17,612 --> 01:22:21,116
Mashers went out
with whalebone corsets and hairnets.

1189
01:22:21,658 --> 01:22:24,828
- Did you ever hear the expression "wolf"?
- Sure, I've heard that.

1190
01:22:24,994 --> 01:22:28,414
- It just slipped my mind.
- Slipped your mind. Naturally, it would.

1191
01:22:28,498 --> 01:22:31,125
Clanking around in there
with those rusty old mashers.

1192
01:22:31,209 --> 01:22:34,671
Have you ever known a man
who you could call a wolf?

1193
01:22:34,963 --> 01:22:37,715
- I'm not sure.
- Was Barney Quill a wolf?

1194
01:22:37,882 --> 01:22:39,175
- I couldn't say.
- Or wouldn't.

1195
01:22:39,259 --> 01:22:41,219
- Objection.
- Sustained.

1196
01:22:41,302 --> 01:22:44,138
The question was answered.
He said he couldn't say.

1197
01:22:45,014 --> 01:22:47,850
Mr. Paquette, when Barney returned...

1198
01:22:47,976 --> 01:22:50,186
...from wherever he had gone...

1199
01:22:50,270 --> 01:22:52,230
...did he relieve you at the bar?
- Yes.

1200
01:22:52,647 --> 01:22:55,650
- What did he say?
- He said, "I'll take over."

1201
01:22:55,858 --> 01:22:58,152
Coming out from behind the bar,
where did you go?

1202
01:22:59,320 --> 01:23:02,073
I went over to the Pedersons' table.

1203
01:23:02,573 --> 01:23:06,077
You testified that you were by the door
when Lt. Manion came in.

1204
01:23:06,160 --> 01:23:09,247
You were by the door
because the Pedersons' table was there?

1205
01:23:09,372 --> 01:23:10,665
Yes.

1206
01:23:10,748 --> 01:23:13,501
How long was it
before Lt. Manion came in?

1207
01:23:14,711 --> 01:23:17,880
I don't know exactly. Maybe 30 minutes.

1208
01:23:17,964 --> 01:23:20,466
And you remained with the Pedersons
all that time?

1209
01:23:20,550 --> 01:23:21,968
Yes. They're my friends.

1210
01:23:22,135 --> 01:23:24,762
Is there also a window beside that table?

1211
01:23:25,096 --> 01:23:26,931
- I think so.
- You think so.

1212
01:23:27,014 --> 01:23:30,268
How long have you worked
at the Thunder Bay Inn?

1213
01:23:30,476 --> 01:23:31,769
Six or seven years.

1214
01:23:31,853 --> 01:23:36,190
Does this window beside the table
suddenly vanish...

1215
01:23:36,315 --> 01:23:40,236
...and then reappear,
and come and go in a ghostly fashion?

1216
01:23:40,319 --> 01:23:41,612
It's there all the time.

1217
01:23:41,696 --> 01:23:45,533
While you were talking to your friends,
did you look out the window?

1218
01:23:46,242 --> 01:23:48,202
- I might have.
- When you looked out...

1219
01:23:48,286 --> 01:23:51,956
...were you looking for something?
- No, I wasn't looking for anything.

1220
01:23:52,081 --> 01:23:56,544
Didn't Barney Quill tell you to go
to the window and watch out for Manion?

1221
01:23:59,964 --> 01:24:02,633
Did he tell you to look out for Lt. Manion?

1222
01:24:03,175 --> 01:24:04,594
He did not.

1223
01:24:06,596 --> 01:24:10,391
Barney was quite a marksman, wasn't he?
With guns.

1224
01:24:10,558 --> 01:24:12,560
He'd won prizes for shooting, hadn't he?

1225
01:24:13,060 --> 01:24:16,397
- Yes.
- Did he keep any guns behind the bar?

1226
01:24:22,570 --> 01:24:24,030
He might have.

1227
01:24:24,113 --> 01:24:28,117
Isn't it a fact that there are three
concealed pistol racks behind the bar?

1228
01:24:28,492 --> 01:24:31,996
The defendant's plea is one of insanity,
not self-defence.

1229
01:24:32,163 --> 01:24:35,833
I'm sure Mr. Biegler hasn't forgotten that,
Mr. Lodwick.

1230
01:24:36,083 --> 01:24:37,376
You may answer.

1231
01:24:37,460 --> 01:24:40,254
Are there concealed gun racks
behind the bar?

1232
01:24:40,671 --> 01:24:43,883
- Yes.
- How many people know of the gun racks?

1233
01:24:44,467 --> 01:24:45,509
I couldn't say.

1234
01:24:45,593 --> 01:24:49,305
Isn't it a fact that Barney
would sometimes take the guns out...

1235
01:24:49,388 --> 01:24:54,226
...twirling them on his fingers,
to demonstrate his skill to the patrons?

1236
01:24:55,144 --> 01:24:57,646
- I don't remember.
- Try and remember.

1237
01:24:57,730 --> 01:24:59,940
Did you ever see him do that yourself?

1238
01:25:00,733 --> 01:25:01,817
Once or twice.

1239
01:25:01,984 --> 01:25:03,819
That's all, Mr. Paquette.

1240
01:25:03,903 --> 01:25:05,404
No further questions.

1241
01:25:05,488 --> 01:25:06,947
The witness may step down.

1242
01:25:07,031 --> 01:25:09,283
Call George Lemon.

1243
01:25:14,914 --> 01:25:17,249
Biegler's going off in all directions.

1244
01:25:17,750 --> 01:25:19,293
What's he getting at?

1245
01:25:22,546 --> 01:25:25,716
I have a feeling he's afraid
of what we'll get at.

1246
01:25:26,592 --> 01:25:29,136
Mr. Biegler's putting up a smoke screen
for some reason.

1247
01:25:30,220 --> 01:25:31,347
- I do.
- Take the seat, please.

1248
01:25:33,974 --> 01:25:36,769
- Will you state your name, please?
- George Lemon.

1249
01:25:37,394 --> 01:25:39,313
What kind of work do you do?

1250
01:25:39,605 --> 01:25:42,441
I'm caretaker of the tourist park
in Thunder Bay.

1251
01:25:42,524 --> 01:25:44,443
I see the place is clean and orderly.

1252
01:25:44,568 --> 01:25:47,112
I check people in and out,
lock the gate at night.

1253
01:25:47,780 --> 01:25:50,407
What is your authority for these duties?

1254
01:25:50,658 --> 01:25:54,328
I'm paid by Mastodon township
and I'm also a deputy sheriff...

1255
01:25:54,453 --> 01:25:55,871
...just courtesy, sort of.

1256
01:25:56,538 --> 01:25:59,333
Did you see Lt. Manion
on the night of the 15th...

1257
01:25:59,666 --> 01:26:02,378
...the night Barney Quill was killed?
- Yes, sir.

1258
01:26:03,337 --> 01:26:05,339
Will you tell the court...

1259
01:26:05,422 --> 01:26:10,260
...about how and when
you saw Lt. Manion?

1260
01:26:10,719 --> 01:26:13,514
About 1:00 a.m.,
a knock on my door waked me up.

1261
01:26:13,597 --> 01:26:16,183
I went to the door
and Lt. Manion was standing there.

1262
01:26:16,266 --> 01:26:20,521
He said, "You better take me, Mr. Lemon,
because I just shot Barney Quill."

1263
01:26:21,230 --> 01:26:24,441
I told him to go to his trailer
and that I would call the police.

1264
01:26:24,775 --> 01:26:28,445
How did Lt. Manion appear to you
when he asked you to take him?

1265
01:26:28,737 --> 01:26:32,157
He said what he had to and did what I said.
There wasn't any fuss.

1266
01:26:32,282 --> 01:26:35,452
Did he appear to be,
as far as you could tell...

1267
01:26:35,786 --> 01:26:37,996
...in complete possession of his faculties?

1268
01:26:38,413 --> 01:26:40,249
As far as I could tell, yes, sir.

1269
01:26:41,959 --> 01:26:43,460
Take the witness.

1270
01:26:43,961 --> 01:26:47,464
Mr. Lemon,
did you go to the Manions' trailer?

1271
01:26:47,631 --> 01:26:48,674
Yes, sir.

1272
01:26:48,757 --> 01:26:51,426
- Did you see Mrs. Manion at the trailer?
- Yes, sir.

1273
01:26:51,593 --> 01:26:53,220
What was her appearance?

1274
01:26:54,221 --> 01:26:55,639
She was a mess.

1275
01:26:57,015 --> 01:26:59,518
Objection.
No evidence has been introduced...

1276
01:26:59,643 --> 01:27:02,104
...to make Mrs. Manion's
appearance relevant.

1277
01:27:02,270 --> 01:27:05,941
No evidence was introduced to make
Barney Quill's appearance relevant...

1278
01:27:06,024 --> 01:27:07,776
...but you didn't object to that.

1279
01:27:07,901 --> 01:27:11,697
Is that because you know
that Barney Quill bathed and changed...

1280
01:27:11,780 --> 01:27:14,324
...after he raped and beat
this poor woman?

1281
01:27:14,408 --> 01:27:18,578
Everybody in this court is being tried
except Frederick Manion. I protest...

1282
01:27:18,704 --> 01:27:22,791
This is a cross-examination
in a murder case, not a high-school debate!

1283
01:27:22,874 --> 01:27:26,503
What are you trying to do,
railroad this soldier into the clink?

1284
01:27:26,586 --> 01:27:29,339
Mr. Biegler,
you are an experienced attorney...

1285
01:27:29,464 --> 01:27:32,175
...and you know better
than to make such an outburst.

1286
01:27:32,259 --> 01:27:35,387
I will not tolerate
intemperance of this sort.

1287
01:27:35,470 --> 01:27:38,515
If you once again try the patience
of this court...

1288
01:27:38,598 --> 01:27:40,642
...I shall hold you in contempt.

1289
01:27:42,352 --> 01:27:43,395
Sorry.

1290
01:27:44,437 --> 01:27:45,647
Your Honour...

1291
01:27:46,523 --> 01:27:48,108
...I apologise.

1292
01:27:48,817 --> 01:27:49,985
It won't happen again.

1293
01:27:50,277 --> 01:27:54,698
The witness' answer will be stricken
and the jury will disregard the answer.

1294
01:27:55,448 --> 01:27:57,742
Now you may proceed, Mr. Biegler.

1295
01:27:57,868 --> 01:27:59,119
Yes, sir.

1296
01:28:00,036 --> 01:28:01,496
Mr. Lemon.

1297
01:28:02,038 --> 01:28:05,667
On the night when Lt. Manion
awakened you and turned himself in...

1298
01:28:05,750 --> 01:28:07,252
...had you been awakened before?

1299
01:28:07,335 --> 01:28:10,130
- Had anything else disturbed your slumber?
- No, sir.

1300
01:28:10,380 --> 01:28:12,173
There were no soldiers singing?

1301
01:28:12,257 --> 01:28:14,718
No, sir. Not in my park after 10:00.

1302
01:28:15,010 --> 01:28:16,970
There were no women screaming?

1303
01:28:17,262 --> 01:28:19,139
Those screams were down by the gate.

1304
01:28:19,264 --> 01:28:20,598
Objection!

1305
01:28:20,765 --> 01:28:23,435
I see no reason for objecting yet.

1306
01:28:24,060 --> 01:28:26,563
Tell us about those screams, Mr. Lemon.

1307
01:28:27,272 --> 01:28:28,940
I didn't hear them myself.

1308
01:28:29,024 --> 01:28:33,028
Some tourists from Ohio in the park
heard them and told me the next day.

1309
01:28:33,153 --> 01:28:34,195
Mr. Lodwick?

1310
01:28:34,279 --> 01:28:37,240
This testimony is incompetent, hearsay...

1311
01:28:37,323 --> 01:28:40,285
...irrelevant, immaterial, inconclusive...

1312
01:28:40,368 --> 01:28:42,287
That's too much for me.

1313
01:28:42,829 --> 01:28:44,539
The witness is yours.

1314
01:28:46,916 --> 01:28:48,418
No questions.

1315
01:28:48,877 --> 01:28:50,628
The witness may step down.

1316
01:28:50,920 --> 01:28:52,464
Call your next witness.

1317
01:28:54,799 --> 01:28:56,885
Detective Sgt. James Durgo.

1318
01:28:58,887 --> 01:29:00,680
- Hi, Pauly.
- Hi, Jim.

1319
01:29:03,016 --> 01:29:06,144
As soon as we break,
you'd better phone that Army psychiatrist.

1320
01:29:06,227 --> 01:29:08,605
- Tell him to be here day after tomorrow.
- Will do.

1321
01:29:09,314 --> 01:29:12,483
Will you please tell me
where Parnell has gone?

1322
01:29:12,567 --> 01:29:13,902
Won't do.

1323
01:29:14,277 --> 01:29:15,778
You're fired!

1324
01:29:16,905 --> 01:29:19,449
You can't fire me till you pay me.

1325
01:29:21,910 --> 01:29:24,829
Were you called to Thunder Bay
by Deputy Sheriff Lemon...

1326
01:29:24,913 --> 01:29:27,916
...on the night Barney Quill was killed?
- Yes, sir, I was.

1327
01:29:29,000 --> 01:29:31,002
My companion officer and I
were first on the case.

1328
01:29:31,252 --> 01:29:34,839
Sgt. Durgo, when you arrived
at the Manion trailer, who was there?

1329
01:29:35,048 --> 01:29:36,924
Lt. Manion and his wife.

1330
01:29:37,425 --> 01:29:39,761
What did Lt. Manion say to you?

1331
01:29:40,762 --> 01:29:43,806
He said his wife had had some trouble
with Barney Quill...

1332
01:29:44,140 --> 01:29:46,768
...and that he'd gone to the tavern
and shot Quill.

1333
01:29:46,976 --> 01:29:50,188
He asked whether Quill was dead or not,
we told him he was.

1334
01:29:50,396 --> 01:29:52,857
How did Lt. Manion take this information?

1335
01:29:53,524 --> 01:29:54,984
He didn't seem surprised.

1336
01:29:55,193 --> 01:29:56,861
What did you do then?

1337
01:29:57,236 --> 01:29:58,946
I asked for the gun he'd used.

1338
01:29:59,197 --> 01:30:03,201
Did you take Lt. Manion
to the jail here in Iron City that night?

1339
01:30:03,493 --> 01:30:06,245
Yes, sir. We drove the lieutenant down
with his wife.

1340
01:30:06,329 --> 01:30:10,291
On the drive to Iron City,
did the lieutenant talk about the shooting?

1341
01:30:11,584 --> 01:30:15,171
He said that if he could do
the whole thing again, he'd still do it.

1342
01:30:15,630 --> 01:30:19,050
During all this,
at the trailer, the drive to Iron City...

1343
01:30:19,175 --> 01:30:20,760
...how did Lt. Manion appear?

1344
01:30:22,178 --> 01:30:24,305
He was very quiet most of the time.

1345
01:30:24,514 --> 01:30:25,681
Seemed clear-headed.

1346
01:30:25,806 --> 01:30:29,519
Would you say he was
in complete possession of his faculties?

1347
01:30:30,019 --> 01:30:31,562
He seemed so to me.

1348
01:30:31,771 --> 01:30:32,772
Your witness.

1349
01:30:33,189 --> 01:30:37,526
You testified that Lt. Manion
told you that he shot Barney Quill...

1350
01:30:37,610 --> 01:30:41,614
...after he had learned that his wife
had had some trouble with Quill.

1351
01:30:42,156 --> 01:30:45,576
Were these the words
Lt. Manion used: "some trouble"?

1352
01:30:45,952 --> 01:30:47,912
No, sir. Those were my words, not his.

1353
01:30:48,246 --> 01:30:50,831
Was it your notion to use your own words?

1354
01:30:50,957 --> 01:30:52,750
No, sir, it was not.

1355
01:30:53,000 --> 01:30:55,169
Was the suggestion
to call it "some trouble"...

1356
01:30:55,252 --> 01:30:57,838
...made by somebody in this courtroom?

1357
01:31:00,049 --> 01:31:01,342
Yes, sir, it was.

1358
01:31:02,551 --> 01:31:07,306
Would you tell the court
what words Lt. Manion actually used...

1359
01:31:07,390 --> 01:31:09,433
...to describe the trouble his wife had?

1360
01:31:09,600 --> 01:31:12,353
Objection. We've been over this before.

1361
01:31:12,478 --> 01:31:15,523
This would not be relevant
to any issues before the court.

1362
01:31:15,606 --> 01:31:20,861
The statement "some trouble" came out
during the examination of Sgt. Durgo.

1363
01:31:21,404 --> 01:31:26,534
Up to now, you've adroitly restricted
all testimony concerning Laura Manion.

1364
01:31:26,784 --> 01:31:30,246
The cat's out of the bag,
it's fair game for me to chase it.

1365
01:31:30,454 --> 01:31:33,666
This is a sore point, Mr. Biegler,
and it's getting sorer.

1366
01:31:33,916 --> 01:31:35,501
I'd like to hear the prosecution.

1367
01:31:36,085 --> 01:31:37,753
The burden is on the defence...

1368
01:31:37,837 --> 01:31:40,714
...to prove temporary insanity
at the time of the shooting.

1369
01:31:40,840 --> 01:31:44,760
If the reason for the alleged insanity
is important to this case...

1370
01:31:44,885 --> 01:31:47,388
...then it's a matter
for a competent witness.

1371
01:31:47,471 --> 01:31:50,182
An expert on the subject
of the human mind.

1372
01:31:51,225 --> 01:31:53,811
What the defence is trying to do...

1373
01:31:53,894 --> 01:31:56,647
...is introduce some sensational material...

1374
01:31:56,814 --> 01:31:59,692
...for the purposes of obscuring
the real issues.

1375
01:32:00,859 --> 01:32:05,573
Your Honour, how can the jury accurately
estimate the testimony being given here...

1376
01:32:05,656 --> 01:32:09,034
...unless they first know the reason
behind this whole trial:

1377
01:32:09,201 --> 01:32:12,079
Why Lt. Manion shot Barney Quill?

1378
01:32:12,162 --> 01:32:15,958
Now, the prosecution would like
to separate the motive from the act.

1379
01:32:17,001 --> 01:32:21,171
That's like trying to take the core
from an apple without breaking the skin.

1380
01:32:21,255 --> 01:32:26,176
The core of our defence is that
the defendant's temporary insanity...

1381
01:32:26,468 --> 01:32:29,638
...was triggered by this
so-called trouble with Quill.

1382
01:32:29,722 --> 01:32:31,765
I beg the court...

1383
01:32:33,100 --> 01:32:36,395
I beg the court to let me cut into the apple.

1384
01:32:38,522 --> 01:32:40,816
Our objection still stands, Your Honour.

1385
01:32:55,581 --> 01:32:57,166
Objection overruled.

1386
01:33:06,300 --> 01:33:09,553
Tell the court how Lt. Manion
described the trouble...

1387
01:33:09,678 --> 01:33:11,555
...his wife had with Barney Quill.

1388
01:33:11,805 --> 01:33:14,725
He told us that Quill had raped his wife.

1389
01:33:15,058 --> 01:33:19,271
Can you recall what Lt. Manion
told you about the rape?

1390
01:33:19,771 --> 01:33:20,981
Yes, sir.

1391
01:33:21,106 --> 01:33:23,859
He said he'd been asleep
since right after dinner.

1392
01:33:24,318 --> 01:33:28,113
He was waked up by some noise,
screams, he thought.

1393
01:33:28,447 --> 01:33:32,326
He got up,
opened the trailer door and went outside.

1394
01:33:32,534 --> 01:33:35,662
His wife came running out of the dark
and fell into his arms.

1395
01:33:36,079 --> 01:33:38,915
You saw his wife in the trailer.
How'd she look?

1396
01:33:38,999 --> 01:33:42,127
She was a little hysterical.
She'd been pretty badly beaten up.

1397
01:33:42,210 --> 01:33:45,088
She had big, black bruises
over her face and arms.

1398
01:33:45,339 --> 01:33:48,133
Did Mrs. Manion tell you
about this rape and beating?

1399
01:33:48,216 --> 01:33:49,301
She did.

1400
01:33:49,426 --> 01:33:51,428
Did she take you to where it happened?

1401
01:33:51,511 --> 01:33:52,721
Yes, the next morning.

1402
01:33:52,846 --> 01:33:54,181
Did you find anything?

1403
01:33:54,264 --> 01:33:58,018
Any evidence pertaining to the story
that Mrs. Manion had told you?

1404
01:33:58,727 --> 01:34:03,231
On the lane in the woods,
we found tyre tracks and dog tracks...

1405
01:34:03,690 --> 01:34:07,527
...and a leather case
with some horn-rimmed glasses inside.

1406
01:34:08,320 --> 01:34:13,992
We also looked for a certain undergarment
of Mrs. Manion's, but we didn't find it.

1407
01:34:14,326 --> 01:34:18,163
Will the attorneys for both sides
approach the bench, please?

1408
01:34:21,082 --> 01:34:25,045
Mr. Biegler, you finally got
your rape into the case...

1409
01:34:25,253 --> 01:34:29,090
...and I think all the details
should now be made clear to the jury.

1410
01:34:29,174 --> 01:34:30,800
Do you agree, Mr. Lodwick?

1411
01:34:31,384 --> 01:34:32,385
Absolutely.

1412
01:34:33,094 --> 01:34:36,556
What exactly was the undergarment
just referred to?

1413
01:34:36,640 --> 01:34:38,225
Panties, Your Honour.

1414
01:34:38,308 --> 01:34:40,518
Do you expect this subject
to come up again?

1415
01:34:40,602 --> 01:34:41,978
Yes, sir.

1416
01:34:42,103 --> 01:34:46,274
There's a certain light connotation
attached to the word "panties."

1417
01:34:46,524 --> 01:34:48,526
Can we find another name for them?

1418
01:34:48,610 --> 01:34:51,196
I've never heard my wife
call them anything else.

1419
01:34:52,656 --> 01:34:54,532
I'm a bachelor, Your Honour.

1420
01:34:54,616 --> 01:34:57,410
That's a great help. Mr. Dancer?

1421
01:34:57,494 --> 01:35:02,165
When I was overseas during the war,
Your Honour, I learned a French word.

1422
01:35:02,374 --> 01:35:04,876
I'm afraid it might be slightly suggestive.

1423
01:35:04,959 --> 01:35:06,753
Most French words are.

1424
01:35:06,920 --> 01:35:09,464
All right, gentlemen, back to your places.

1425
01:35:10,757 --> 01:35:15,136
For the benefit of the jury,
but more especially for the spectators...

1426
01:35:15,428 --> 01:35:19,307
...the undergarment referred to
in the testimony was, to be exact...

1427
01:35:19,682 --> 01:35:21,351
...Mrs. Manion's panties.

1428
01:35:25,438 --> 01:35:29,150
I wanted you to get
your snickering over and done with.

1429
01:35:29,275 --> 01:35:33,446
This pair of panties will be mentioned
again in the course of this trial.

1430
01:35:33,780 --> 01:35:38,284
When it happens, there will not be
one laugh, one snicker, one giggle...

1431
01:35:38,409 --> 01:35:41,162
...or even one smirk in my courtroom.

1432
01:35:41,412 --> 01:35:45,208
There isn't anything comic
about a pair of panties...

1433
01:35:45,291 --> 01:35:48,795
...which figure in the violent death
of one man...

1434
01:35:48,878 --> 01:35:52,215
...and the possible incarceration of another.

1435
01:35:53,007 --> 01:35:54,467
Proceed, Mr. Biegler.

1436
01:35:54,551 --> 01:35:57,053
Did you give Mrs. Manion
a lie-detector test?

1437
01:35:57,136 --> 01:36:00,473
Objection. A polygraph test
is inadmissible evidence in our courts.

1438
01:36:00,557 --> 01:36:03,768
I only asked if he gave the test.
I didn't ask the results.

1439
01:36:04,102 --> 01:36:05,561
He may answer that.

1440
01:36:06,104 --> 01:36:09,023
I gave her a lie-detector test
at her request.

1441
01:36:09,190 --> 01:36:12,777
Now, after all this investigation,
did you believe Mrs. Manion?

1442
01:36:12,860 --> 01:36:13,903
I did.

1443
01:36:13,987 --> 01:36:17,198
- Even after the lie-detector test?
- I object to that question.

1444
01:36:17,281 --> 01:36:21,285
It constitutes flagrant subterfuge
on the part of the defence counsel.

1445
01:36:21,369 --> 01:36:23,204
Objection sustained.

1446
01:36:23,830 --> 01:36:27,500
Ladies and gentlemen of the jury,
a polygraph or lie-detector test...

1447
01:36:27,583 --> 01:36:31,421
...is not admissible in evidence,
because no one has ever been sure...

1448
01:36:31,546 --> 01:36:35,258
...that some people couldn't lie
to a lie detector and get away with it.

1449
01:36:35,550 --> 01:36:36,843
Go ahead.

1450
01:36:37,260 --> 01:36:41,389
In any case, Sgt. Durgo, you, yourself,
in your own heart and mind...

1451
01:36:41,472 --> 01:36:43,850
...are quite convinced
of Mrs. Manion's honesty.

1452
01:36:44,058 --> 01:36:45,977
- Yes, sir.
- That's all.

1453
01:36:48,020 --> 01:36:49,647
Just a moment.

1454
01:36:55,027 --> 01:36:58,364
Did you look for the panties
elsewhere than the lane in the woods?

1455
01:36:58,447 --> 01:37:01,742
We looked in Barney Quill's car
and his room in the hotel.

1456
01:37:01,826 --> 01:37:03,244
We didn't find the panties.

1457
01:37:03,327 --> 01:37:06,414
Do you know why Mrs. Manion
requested a lie-detector test?

1458
01:37:06,789 --> 01:37:08,791
- I know what she said.
- What was that?

1459
01:37:08,875 --> 01:37:12,837
She wanted everybody to believe her story
as she knew it would help her husband.

1460
01:37:12,920 --> 01:37:14,630
Was that the only reason she gave?

1461
01:37:14,881 --> 01:37:18,843
Said she'd already sworn to her husband
and she wanted everybody to believe it.

1462
01:37:18,926 --> 01:37:21,137
One moment please, Your Honour.

1463
01:37:24,599 --> 01:37:26,809
Ask him in what manner she swore.

1464
01:37:27,351 --> 01:37:30,605
Did Mrs. Manion say
how she had sworn to her husband?

1465
01:37:30,771 --> 01:37:33,649
Yes, sir.
She said she had sworn on a rosary.

1466
01:37:35,109 --> 01:37:39,280
Sergeant, this lane in the woods:
What's it used for? Where does it go?

1467
01:37:39,655 --> 01:37:42,950
It used to be a logging road.
Doesn't go any place, just stops.

1468
01:37:43,034 --> 01:37:44,410
Who uses it now?

1469
01:37:44,994 --> 01:37:47,204
I think it's a road kids drive down to park.

1470
01:37:47,288 --> 01:37:49,915
- It's a lovers' lane?
- I think so, yes.

1471
01:37:49,999 --> 01:37:52,585
- The witness is yours.
- No more questions.

1472
01:37:52,710 --> 01:37:54,170
The witness may step down.

1473
01:37:54,253 --> 01:37:58,758
In view of the evidence concerning rape,
which Your Honour has ruled admissible...

1474
01:37:58,841 --> 01:38:01,677
...we ask for a 30-minute recess
in order that we may...

1475
01:38:01,761 --> 01:38:04,346
...bring in a witness
we had not anticipated using.

1476
01:38:04,638 --> 01:38:06,932
All right, we'll take a 30-minute recess.

1477
01:38:07,016 --> 01:38:08,476
Recess.

1478
01:38:15,399 --> 01:38:18,110
Why didn't you tell me about that rosary?

1479
01:38:19,236 --> 01:38:20,738
We forgot it.

1480
01:38:21,280 --> 01:38:25,743
We didn't forget it. Manny said,
maybe we shouldn't tell that again.

1481
01:38:26,243 --> 01:38:30,497
It might've looked like something else.
Like I didn't believe her.

1482
01:38:31,248 --> 01:38:33,167
How much more didn't you tell me?

1483
01:38:33,250 --> 01:38:36,503
Everything else.
We told you everything else.

1484
01:38:36,629 --> 01:38:38,339
Is that right, Laura?

1485
01:38:38,505 --> 01:38:40,382
Yes, everything else.

1486
01:38:40,549 --> 01:38:42,801
All right, now get this, both of you:

1487
01:38:42,927 --> 01:38:46,680
When you get up on that stand,
I want you to tell the truth.

1488
01:38:46,847 --> 01:38:49,308
I don't want you to tell anything
but the truth.

1489
01:38:49,391 --> 01:38:54,104
Don't try and lie or conceal anything,
or you'll get skinned alive.

1490
01:38:54,605 --> 01:38:56,982
This fellow Dancer's gonna move in.

1491
01:39:18,128 --> 01:39:21,548
Doctor Dompierre, did you have occasion
to come to the county jail...

1492
01:39:21,632 --> 01:39:23,675
...the night of August 15 of this year?

1493
01:39:23,759 --> 01:39:24,802
I did.

1494
01:39:24,927 --> 01:39:27,930
- Who called you to the jail?
- The police authorities.

1495
01:39:28,013 --> 01:39:30,057
What did they want you to do?

1496
01:39:30,182 --> 01:39:33,227
They wanted me to make a test
for the presence of sperm...

1497
01:39:33,310 --> 01:39:35,479
...on the person
of a Mrs. Frederick Manion.

1498
01:39:35,562 --> 01:39:36,647
I made the test.

1499
01:39:36,730 --> 01:39:39,525
In making this test,
what was your conclusion?

1500
01:39:39,608 --> 01:39:41,443
Negative. There was none.

1501
01:39:41,527 --> 01:39:43,529
Your witness, Mr. Biegler.

1502
01:39:44,071 --> 01:39:47,324
In making these tests,
did you notice any bruises or marks...

1503
01:39:47,407 --> 01:39:49,117
...on Mrs. Manion at that time?

1504
01:39:49,201 --> 01:39:50,244
I did.

1505
01:39:50,327 --> 01:39:52,913
Were you asked about
the reason for these bruises?

1506
01:39:52,996 --> 01:39:54,289
I was not.

1507
01:39:54,373 --> 01:39:57,292
Where did you do the lab work
on your test for sperm?

1508
01:39:57,417 --> 01:39:59,378
St. Margaret's Hospital in this city.

1509
01:39:59,878 --> 01:40:03,674
- Who worked up the slides for you?
- A technician at the hospital.

1510
01:40:04,424 --> 01:40:08,512
Wouldn't it have been better to have
these slides worked up by a pathologist...

1511
01:40:08,595 --> 01:40:10,347
...or an expert in this field?

1512
01:40:10,430 --> 01:40:12,975
Yes, but the police were in a hurry.

1513
01:40:13,058 --> 01:40:15,727
I knew this fellow came on at 7:00 a.m.

1514
01:40:15,852 --> 01:40:18,647
Wouldn't it have been better
to wait for the expert...

1515
01:40:18,730 --> 01:40:21,441
...if the possible question of rape
hung on the result?

1516
01:40:21,525 --> 01:40:22,651
It would've been.

1517
01:40:22,901 --> 01:40:25,862
In the newspaper,
on the evening of August 16...

1518
01:40:25,946 --> 01:40:28,990
...it was stated you found
no evidence of rape. Is that true?

1519
01:40:29,282 --> 01:40:31,618
It is not true. I made no such statement.

1520
01:40:31,702 --> 01:40:35,789
Did you form an opinion as to
whether Mrs. Manion had been raped?

1521
01:40:35,872 --> 01:40:37,707
- No.
- Why didn't you form an opinion?

1522
01:40:38,083 --> 01:40:42,337
It's impossible to tell if a mature,
married woman has been raped.

1523
01:40:42,504 --> 01:40:43,797
That's all.

1524
01:40:43,880 --> 01:40:48,426
Did you have an opinion about whether
she'd had any recent relations with a man?

1525
01:40:48,844 --> 01:40:51,680
Insofar as no sperm was present...

1526
01:40:51,763 --> 01:40:55,225
...it didn't appear that she had had
recent relations with a man.

1527
01:40:55,308 --> 01:40:56,893
Just one more question:

1528
01:40:56,977 --> 01:40:59,646
The fact that no evidence was present
in her body...

1529
01:40:59,729 --> 01:41:02,065
...does not mean that she was not raped,
does it?

1530
01:41:02,148 --> 01:41:03,191
No.

1531
01:41:03,275 --> 01:41:05,777
Do you know what constitutes rape
under the law?

1532
01:41:05,986 --> 01:41:09,531
Yes, sir. Violation is sufficient for rape.

1533
01:41:10,198 --> 01:41:12,909
- There need not be a completion.
- No further questions.

1534
01:41:12,993 --> 01:41:14,452
The witness may step down.

1535
01:41:14,536 --> 01:41:17,455
The People recall Alphonse Paquette
to the stand.

1536
01:41:17,789 --> 01:41:21,710
Your Honour, since counsel for the defence
has forced the question of rape...

1537
01:41:21,793 --> 01:41:25,046
...it's necessary to take
additional testimony from Mr. Paquette.

1538
01:41:26,381 --> 01:41:28,508
You're still under oath, Mr. Paquette.

1539
01:41:31,136 --> 01:41:34,389
Will you look at Mrs. Manion,
seated behind the defence table?

1540
01:41:34,514 --> 01:41:37,225
Was she dressed like this
on the night of the shooting?

1541
01:41:37,309 --> 01:41:38,893
- No.
- How was she dressed?

1542
01:41:39,019 --> 01:41:43,940
She had on a real tight skirt
and sweater kind of thing, sort of glued on.

1543
01:41:44,399 --> 01:41:46,735
She was wearing
red shoes with high heels.

1544
01:41:46,818 --> 01:41:48,445
Was she wearing hose?

1545
01:41:48,987 --> 01:41:50,321
No, she was bare-legged.

1546
01:41:50,447 --> 01:41:52,365
- Was she wearing a hat?
- No.

1547
01:41:54,200 --> 01:41:57,162
What kind of hair does Mrs. Manion have
under that hat?

1548
01:41:57,287 --> 01:42:00,290
We'd be very happy to show the court
Mrs. Manion's hair.

1549
01:42:00,457 --> 01:42:03,752
Mrs. Manion,
would you take off your hat, please?

1550
01:42:09,382 --> 01:42:11,134
Thank you, Mr. Biegler.

1551
01:42:11,301 --> 01:42:14,554
Mr. Paquette, was she wearing glasses
that night?

1552
01:42:14,929 --> 01:42:17,098
I think she was when she played pinball.

1553
01:42:17,182 --> 01:42:21,352
Considering the tight skirt
and the tight sweater and the bare legs...

1554
01:42:21,978 --> 01:42:24,898
...what was the result in her appearance?

1555
01:42:25,023 --> 01:42:29,319
Would you say Mrs. Manion's appearance
was deliberately voluptuous and enticing?

1556
01:42:29,611 --> 01:42:31,821
You could pretty much see
everything she had.

1557
01:42:31,905 --> 01:42:35,491
The defence will concede that Mrs. Manion,
when dressed informally...

1558
01:42:35,575 --> 01:42:37,660
...is an astonishingly beautiful woman.

1559
01:42:38,328 --> 01:42:40,371
Mrs. Manion, stand up, please.

1560
01:42:40,705 --> 01:42:46,002
As a matter of fact, it's pretty easy
to understand why her husband...

1561
01:42:46,085 --> 01:42:50,965
...became temporarily deranged, seeing
such beauty bruised and torn by a beast.

1562
01:42:51,966 --> 01:42:53,176
I protest.

1563
01:42:53,259 --> 01:42:55,345
Mr. Biegler is the least disciplined...

1564
01:42:55,470 --> 01:42:59,015
...and the most completely out-of-order
attorney I've ever seen.

1565
01:42:59,140 --> 01:43:02,101
The jury will ignore Mr. Biegler's oration.

1566
01:43:05,730 --> 01:43:08,691
Was Mrs. Manion drinking heavily
that night?

1567
01:43:08,858 --> 01:43:12,612
I sold her six drinks myself,
and then Barney got some more for her.

1568
01:43:12,695 --> 01:43:14,072
I don't remember how many.

1569
01:43:14,155 --> 01:43:15,948
Would you say that she was tight?

1570
01:43:16,074 --> 01:43:17,116
She was high all right.

1571
01:43:17,200 --> 01:43:19,494
What did she do
to make you think she was high?

1572
01:43:19,577 --> 01:43:22,121
She took off her shoes
and went barefooted.

1573
01:43:22,246 --> 01:43:23,998
When she played pinball...

1574
01:43:24,081 --> 01:43:26,709
...she'd swish around
to give the machine inkling.

1575
01:43:26,834 --> 01:43:30,630
You mean,
she was flipping her hips around?

1576
01:43:30,880 --> 01:43:32,507
Anything else?

1577
01:43:32,965 --> 01:43:37,929
When she made a good score, she jumped
up and down and squealed like women do.

1578
01:43:38,137 --> 01:43:41,307
She was playing pinball
with Barney Quill that night, wasn't she?

1579
01:43:41,432 --> 01:43:43,643
What was her attitude
toward Barney Quill?

1580
01:43:43,976 --> 01:43:45,269
Friendly, I guess.

1581
01:43:45,394 --> 01:43:46,979
More than friendly?

1582
01:43:47,146 --> 01:43:49,357
- I thought so.
- Why did you think so?

1583
01:43:50,149 --> 01:43:53,069
She'd kind of lean on him...

1584
01:43:53,194 --> 01:43:56,656
...and a couple of times
she bumped him with her hip.

1585
01:43:57,448 --> 01:44:00,826
Would you say that Mrs. Manion
was making a play for Barney Quill?

1586
01:44:01,410 --> 01:44:05,539
Objection. That calls for an assumption
on the part of the witness.

1587
01:44:05,790 --> 01:44:09,835
Would you say that Mrs. Manion
was free and easy with Barney Quill?

1588
01:44:09,919 --> 01:44:10,920
I would.

1589
01:44:11,003 --> 01:44:12,088
Your witness.

1590
01:44:13,714 --> 01:44:17,677
The attorney for the People asked you
if Mrs. Manion was "tight"...

1591
01:44:17,802 --> 01:44:20,096
...and you said she was "high."

1592
01:44:21,013 --> 01:44:24,183
Speaking as a bartender,
what's the distinction between the two?

1593
01:44:24,266 --> 01:44:26,394
I don't think I understand.

1594
01:44:27,395 --> 01:44:31,065
When we say a person is tight,
we usually mean they're a little...

1595
01:44:31,190 --> 01:44:33,234
...stupid with drink, isn't that so?

1596
01:44:33,317 --> 01:44:34,902
I guess that's about it, yes.

1597
01:44:35,069 --> 01:44:37,947
If they're high,
they're gay and enjoying themselves.

1598
01:44:38,072 --> 01:44:39,115
Yes.

1599
01:44:39,240 --> 01:44:41,659
In other words, Mrs. Manion was happy.

1600
01:44:41,742 --> 01:44:44,995
Is there anything wrong with being happy
in Thunder Bay Inn?

1601
01:44:45,204 --> 01:44:50,835
Thunder Bay itself is a resort, isn't it?
Swimming, fishing, that sort of thing?

1602
01:44:51,502 --> 01:44:55,673
Is there anything unusual about seeing
a barefooted woman in Thunder Bay?

1603
01:44:55,840 --> 01:44:58,926
So, Mrs. Manion's taking her shoes off
in Thunder Bay...

1604
01:44:59,009 --> 01:45:02,263
...doesn't necessarily mean
she was being unladylike, does it?

1605
01:45:02,346 --> 01:45:03,764
- I guess not.
- Yes or no?

1606
01:45:03,848 --> 01:45:04,890
No.

1607
01:45:07,810 --> 01:45:12,982
You testified that Mrs. Manion
was squealing and jumping up and down...

1608
01:45:15,150 --> 01:45:20,281
...and "swishing her hips"
around the pinball machine.

1609
01:45:20,572 --> 01:45:24,118
Was she creating a disturbance?
Was she attracting a crowd?

1610
01:45:24,368 --> 01:45:27,871
Were all the men at the bar
standing around watching Mrs. Manion?

1611
01:45:27,997 --> 01:45:30,165
But you were very conscious
of Mrs. Manion.

1612
01:45:30,249 --> 01:45:33,168
You were so conscious
that you can tell us all this.

1613
01:45:33,335 --> 01:45:37,756
Barney Quill was conscious of Mrs. Manion
because he was playing pinball with her.

1614
01:45:37,881 --> 01:45:39,133
Wouldn't you say so?

1615
01:45:39,258 --> 01:45:44,096
So, it seems only you and Barney Quill
were acutely aware of Mrs. Manion...

1616
01:45:44,179 --> 01:45:46,098
...her actions and her appearance.

1617
01:45:46,223 --> 01:45:49,393
Maybe when good old Barney
came to get some drinks from you...

1618
01:45:49,518 --> 01:45:53,647
...maybe he winked and said,
"I'm gonna take this babe and rape her."

1619
01:45:53,731 --> 01:45:54,815
No, he didn't.

1620
01:45:54,940 --> 01:45:57,818
Yeah, and maybe you said,
"Do it once for me, boss."

1621
01:45:57,901 --> 01:46:00,154
Objection!
Counsel is attacking the witness.

1622
01:46:00,237 --> 01:46:01,989
No more questions.

1623
01:46:02,865 --> 01:46:06,660
The court's had about all of this dogfight
it can take for one day.

1624
01:46:06,785 --> 01:46:10,122
I'm sure the jury
is equally tired and hungry.

1625
01:46:10,456 --> 01:46:12,249
Tomorrow, the defence takes over.

1626
01:46:12,374 --> 01:46:15,377
With expedition, prayer,
and a little self-discipline...

1627
01:46:15,460 --> 01:46:19,590
...on the part of the counsel, perhaps
we can reach an end by Saturday night.

1628
01:46:19,673 --> 01:46:21,633
Will you adjourn court?

1629
01:46:24,178 --> 01:46:27,598
This court stands adjourned
until 9:00 a.m. Tomorrow.

1630
01:47:09,056 --> 01:47:11,850
He's banged up a little, but nothing else.

1631
01:47:11,933 --> 01:47:14,478
We'd like to watch him for a day or so.

1632
01:47:14,561 --> 01:47:16,521
How much damage did he do?

1633
01:47:16,605 --> 01:47:21,818
He wrecked a gate and a barn door
and he hasn't got a driver's license.

1634
01:47:23,570 --> 01:47:28,658
He'll have to appear in the J.P. Court
when he's able, the old fool.

1635
01:47:29,159 --> 01:47:31,244
Speak kindly of the dead.

1636
01:47:31,536 --> 01:47:34,581
- Can I have a minute with the corpse?
- Sure, Pauly.

1637
01:47:39,961 --> 01:47:44,674
Was it worth trying to kill yourself
for whatever it is you've been up to?

1638
01:47:45,258 --> 01:47:46,968
How's the trial going?

1639
01:47:47,052 --> 01:47:51,097
I'm making a lot of noise.
Dancer's racking up all the points.

1640
01:47:51,181 --> 01:47:52,933
Where've you been?

1641
01:47:53,934 --> 01:47:57,395
Quill hired Mary Pilant
up north of Sault Sainte Marie.

1642
01:47:58,104 --> 01:48:02,150
It struck me funny he'd go up there
to hire somebody just to work for him.

1643
01:48:02,233 --> 01:48:04,569
I've been up there nosing around.

1644
01:48:04,694 --> 01:48:06,780
Did you find anything useful?

1645
01:48:06,863 --> 01:48:09,783
Not until I looked up her birth certificate.

1646
01:48:10,075 --> 01:48:15,080
Born: Blind River, Ontario, 1934,
out of wedlock.

1647
01:48:15,622 --> 01:48:19,125
Mother was a waitress. Simone Platt.

1648
01:48:19,876 --> 01:48:24,214
Father was a lumberjack
named Barney Quill.

1649
01:48:32,013 --> 01:48:34,391
I'd like to see Miss Mary Pilant.

1650
01:48:34,516 --> 01:48:35,642
It's late, mister.

1651
01:48:35,725 --> 01:48:37,727
I know. This is important.

1652
01:48:37,811 --> 01:48:39,979
- Real important?
- Real important.

1653
01:48:45,193 --> 01:48:48,112
Miss Pilant? Sorry if I woke you.
There's a guy to see you.

1654
01:48:48,196 --> 01:48:49,531
Says it's important.

1655
01:48:49,614 --> 01:48:50,990
- What's your...
- Biegler.

1656
01:48:51,866 --> 01:48:53,159
<i>I don't wish to see him.</i>

1657
01:48:55,703 --> 01:48:58,289
She said it's not important enough.

1658
01:48:58,456 --> 01:49:01,918
You call her back and tell her
I mentioned Blind River, Ontario.

1659
01:49:02,085 --> 01:49:03,878
I'll be in the bar.

1660
01:49:21,938 --> 01:49:24,315
Drinking, Mr. Biegler, or just snooping?

1661
01:49:24,649 --> 01:49:26,192
I'll try a little of both.

1662
01:49:26,276 --> 01:49:29,070
What do you say we start out with a beer?

1663
01:49:33,366 --> 01:49:34,617
On the house.

1664
01:49:34,701 --> 01:49:38,496
That's all you get: A beer.
No questions, no answers.

1665
01:49:38,788 --> 01:49:41,040
I'm just a lawyer trying to do my job.

1666
01:49:41,124 --> 01:49:43,167
What are you so afraid of, Al?

1667
01:49:46,421 --> 01:49:48,089
Sit over there, please.

1668
01:49:54,345 --> 01:49:56,806
Miss Pilant, I owe you an apology.

1669
01:49:56,889 --> 01:49:59,517
I was a little rough
when I was out here before.

1670
01:49:59,976 --> 01:50:02,145
I didn't know Barney Quill was your father.

1671
01:50:02,228 --> 01:50:04,230
You didn't come here just to apologise.

1672
01:50:05,022 --> 01:50:06,941
No, but the apology was part of it.

1673
01:50:07,066 --> 01:50:11,487
To tell the truth, I sort of hoped
maybe it would thaw you out a bit.

1674
01:50:11,863 --> 01:50:15,825
All I want you to do is listen to me,
just for a few minutes.

1675
01:50:16,659 --> 01:50:20,955
I need some strong evidence to back up
Laura Manion's story about the rape.

1676
01:50:21,038 --> 01:50:24,584
The prosecution's gonna attack
that story pretty hard.

1677
01:50:25,293 --> 01:50:29,964
If the jury thinks she's lying,
it could turn the decision against Manion.

1678
01:50:30,256 --> 01:50:35,011
Isn't she lying? Barney didn't do
what she said he did. He couldn't have.

1679
01:50:35,803 --> 01:50:37,638
What did you know about your father?

1680
01:50:37,722 --> 01:50:42,893
All I needed to know. He took care of me
and my mother for as long as she lived.

1681
01:50:43,686 --> 01:50:46,605
He was always there when I needed him.

1682
01:50:46,772 --> 01:50:51,652
That's what I know about my father.
Will that back up Laura Manion's story?

1683
01:50:51,736 --> 01:50:54,780
I don't want to get at you.
I don't want to hurt you.

1684
01:50:54,905 --> 01:50:57,199
I appreciate your affection for your father.

1685
01:50:58,576 --> 01:51:03,164
But, as a lawyer, I've had to learn
that people aren't just good or just bad.

1686
01:51:03,247 --> 01:51:05,332
People are many things.

1687
01:51:05,458 --> 01:51:08,711
I kind of have a feeling
that Barney Quill was many things.

1688
01:51:08,794 --> 01:51:10,046
I don't wanna hear it.

1689
01:51:10,713 --> 01:51:14,300
Please, hear me out.
I believe that Barney told Al Paquette...

1690
01:51:14,383 --> 01:51:16,135
...what happened that night.

1691
01:51:16,218 --> 01:51:19,430
He told him to go to this window
and wait for Manion.

1692
01:51:19,513 --> 01:51:22,641
Barney stayed behind the bar,
next to a gun rack.

1693
01:51:22,725 --> 01:51:23,851
Just waiting.

1694
01:51:24,268 --> 01:51:27,897
Manion came in and fired
the minute he got inside that door...

1695
01:51:27,980 --> 01:51:30,441
...and the first shot
went through Barney's heart.

1696
01:51:30,524 --> 01:51:32,902
Here's what I want you to do.

1697
01:51:32,985 --> 01:51:37,531
I want you to try and persuade Al
to come to court as a defence witness...

1698
01:51:37,615 --> 01:51:40,492
...and tell them exactly
what Barney told him that night:

1699
01:51:40,701 --> 01:51:43,621
That he'd raped
and assaulted Mrs. Manion.

1700
01:51:44,121 --> 01:51:48,334
Al wouldn't conceal a thing like that.
Why wouldn't he tell it if it were true?

1701
01:51:48,417 --> 01:51:50,419
I don't know.

1702
01:51:50,502 --> 01:51:55,215
But I know this:
Everybody loves something or someone.

1703
01:51:55,674 --> 01:51:59,637
Me, I love fishing
and an old guy by the name of Parnell.

1704
01:51:59,720 --> 01:52:03,223
Manion loves his freedom,
he'd like to have a little more of it.

1705
01:52:03,307 --> 01:52:06,602
Barney loved you, maybe so does Al.

1706
01:52:07,645 --> 01:52:09,480
I wouldn't blame him.

1707
01:52:09,563 --> 01:52:13,400
But he doesn't want to hurt you.
He doesn't want you to know the truth:

1708
01:52:13,525 --> 01:52:17,738
That Barney could be dangerous and brutal.
If you just ask Al...

1709
01:52:17,821 --> 01:52:19,865
If you just ask him straight out...

1710
01:52:30,084 --> 01:52:35,130
Mr. Biegler knows
that Barney was my father.

1711
01:52:35,214 --> 01:52:38,967
He thinks you know something
about the night my father was killed.

1712
01:52:39,051 --> 01:52:40,969
Something you won't tell.

1713
01:52:41,303 --> 01:52:45,224
Lawyer, I told you once, I'll tell you again:
No questions, no answers.

1714
01:52:45,307 --> 01:52:46,683
Wait, Al.

1715
01:52:49,102 --> 01:52:52,231
Did my father rape Mrs. Manion?

1716
01:52:52,564 --> 01:52:54,858
Barney wouldn't hurt a woman.

1717
01:52:56,318 --> 01:53:00,405
Is there any reason
you wouldn't tell me the truth about that?

1718
01:53:00,948 --> 01:53:02,407
What reason?

1719
01:53:09,081 --> 01:53:10,207
Anything else, Mr. Biegler?

1720
01:53:11,667 --> 01:53:14,503
I'm gonna leave a pass
for you and Al at the trial.

1721
01:53:14,711 --> 01:53:18,131
You might like to watch
Lt. Manion get convicted.

1722
01:53:18,423 --> 01:53:20,550
You gonna talk about
Mary being Barney's kid?

1723
01:53:20,676 --> 01:53:24,471
No, I'm not gonna spread it around, Al.
Thank you for the beer.

1724
01:53:24,721 --> 01:53:26,264
- Good night.
- 'Night.

1725
01:53:31,061 --> 01:53:33,063
All right, now let's get at this rosary thing.

1726
01:53:33,313 --> 01:53:36,525
It's been testified
that your wife swore to you on a rosary...

1727
01:53:36,608 --> 01:53:38,902
...that she'd been raped by Barney Quill.

1728
01:53:39,069 --> 01:53:42,322
Now, did you ask your wife
to swear on a rosary?

1729
01:53:42,781 --> 01:53:45,826
My wife was hysterical
and she wasn't making much sense.

1730
01:53:46,284 --> 01:53:50,664
I thought if I asked her to take an oath
on a rosary it might serve to calm her.

1731
01:53:50,747 --> 01:53:52,207
Make her think more clearly.

1732
01:53:52,290 --> 01:53:54,126
Did the rosary help?

1733
01:53:54,334 --> 01:53:56,920
She was able to tell me, in detail,
what had happened.

1734
01:53:57,003 --> 01:54:00,215
All right, go on from there.
Now, what did you do then?

1735
01:54:02,801 --> 01:54:07,931
I had her lie on the bed
and I got some cold cloths for her head.

1736
01:54:10,517 --> 01:54:12,811
I gave her a drink of brandy.

1737
01:54:14,813 --> 01:54:18,483
After a while, she became calm
and seemed to go to sleep.

1738
01:54:19,484 --> 01:54:24,239
Then I went to the closet,
I got my gun and I loaded it.

1739
01:54:24,364 --> 01:54:28,618
- Was it in your mind to kill Barney Quill?
- No.

1740
01:54:28,702 --> 01:54:32,414
Then why did you go to the closet
and get your gun and load it?

1741
01:54:32,497 --> 01:54:35,166
I knew I had to go to his place,
I thought I'd need it.

1742
01:54:35,250 --> 01:54:36,293
Why?

1743
01:54:37,127 --> 01:54:41,756
I knew Mr. Quill kept guns behind the bar.
I was afraid he might shoot me.

1744
01:54:41,881 --> 01:54:45,719
Might shoot you if you did what?
What were you going to do?

1745
01:54:46,511 --> 01:54:48,013
I'm not sure.

1746
01:54:49,014 --> 01:54:53,143
I remember having some idea
of finding him...

1747
01:54:54,352 --> 01:54:56,896
...and holding him while I called the police.

1748
01:54:57,397 --> 01:54:59,149
Well, that Mr. What's- his-name...

1749
01:54:59,315 --> 01:55:02,402
Mr. Lemon at the tourist court
was a deputy sheriff.

1750
01:55:02,485 --> 01:55:04,446
Why didn't you get him to go with you?

1751
01:55:04,779 --> 01:55:09,367
Maybe because he always seemed to be
just the old caretaker of the park.

1752
01:55:10,493 --> 01:55:15,957
Maybe I wasn't thinking about anything
too clearly, except finding Barney Quill.

1753
01:55:16,332 --> 01:55:19,752
Why didn't you call the state police
before you went to the bar?

1754
01:55:19,961 --> 01:55:21,296
I don't know.

1755
01:55:22,338 --> 01:55:24,090
I was in sort of a daze.

1756
01:55:25,592 --> 01:55:28,720
It was a horrible thing to see
what had been done to my wife.

1757
01:55:28,803 --> 01:55:30,972
You say you were in a sort of a daze.

1758
01:55:31,097 --> 01:55:35,059
When you got to the bar,
did you see that the bar was crowded?

1759
01:55:37,103 --> 01:55:40,523
I didn't see anyone at the bar
except Barney Quill.

1760
01:55:42,901 --> 01:55:44,485
He was the only person I saw.

1761
01:55:44,569 --> 01:55:46,154
What was he doing?

1762
01:55:47,363 --> 01:55:50,700
I think he was just standing there
behind the bar.

1763
01:55:51,910 --> 01:55:54,913
Did he make a threatening move
to get a gun?

1764
01:55:55,121 --> 01:55:56,664
I don't know.

1765
01:55:57,707 --> 01:55:59,417
He may have, I don't know.

1766
01:55:59,500 --> 01:56:03,129
You say you went there to find him,
to hold him for the police?

1767
01:56:04,005 --> 01:56:05,923
Why did you shoot him?

1768
01:56:07,675 --> 01:56:10,011
I don't remember shooting him.

1769
01:56:11,137 --> 01:56:14,891
When you left the bar, do you remember
Alphonse Paquette coming up to you...

1770
01:56:15,016 --> 01:56:17,685
...saying,
"You'd better not run away from this"...

1771
01:56:17,810 --> 01:56:21,230
...and your reply,
"Do you want some, too, buster?"

1772
01:56:21,647 --> 01:56:23,191
Remember that?

1773
01:56:24,400 --> 01:56:28,529
I seem to have a vague recollection
of someone speaking to me...

1774
01:56:29,572 --> 01:56:32,825
...but I don't remember what I said
or what was said to me.

1775
01:56:33,326 --> 01:56:35,870
When did you realize you'd shot Quill?

1776
01:56:39,248 --> 01:56:43,836
I was getting a drink of water.
I remember my throat was so dry it hurt.

1777
01:56:45,797 --> 01:56:50,551
When I put the glass down, I saw the gun
on the kitchen sink beside the tap.

1778
01:56:52,011 --> 01:56:54,263
I noticed the gun was empty.

1779
01:56:54,972 --> 01:56:59,519
I'd like you to show the court and jury...

1780
01:57:00,019 --> 01:57:02,772
...just how you knew this gun was empty.

1781
01:57:03,147 --> 01:57:07,985
This gadget here, when it sticks up,
you know the last round's been fired.

1782
01:57:09,445 --> 01:57:14,033
On the night of the shooting,
did you love your wife?

1783
01:57:14,533 --> 01:57:15,826
Yes, sir.

1784
01:57:16,243 --> 01:57:18,162
Do you still love her?

1785
01:57:21,624 --> 01:57:23,000
Very much.

1786
01:57:23,918 --> 01:57:25,753
The witness is yours, Mr. Dancer.

1787
01:57:29,090 --> 01:57:31,384
How many men have you killed?

1788
01:57:31,550 --> 01:57:33,177
Now, wait a minute!

1789
01:57:33,928 --> 01:57:37,098
A man's war record,
in Lt. Manion's case a great record...

1790
01:57:37,181 --> 01:57:39,141
...shouldn't be used against him.

1791
01:57:39,225 --> 01:57:42,561
I'm as patriotic as the next man...

1792
01:57:42,645 --> 01:57:46,899
...but the simple truth is war can condition
a man to killing other men.

1793
01:57:47,191 --> 01:57:49,110
I just want to know how conditioned...

1794
01:57:49,235 --> 01:57:53,447
...the lieutenant may be to the use
of firearms on other human beings.

1795
01:57:53,656 --> 01:57:55,699
I don't like the question...

1796
01:57:55,783 --> 01:57:59,203
...but I don't see how I can exclude it.
Let him answer.

1797
01:57:59,662 --> 01:58:02,665
I know I killed at least four men in Korea.

1798
01:58:03,332 --> 01:58:07,253
Three with a hand grenade
and one with my service automatic.

1799
01:58:07,586 --> 01:58:11,257
I may have killed others.
A soldier doesn't always know.

1800
01:58:12,091 --> 01:58:15,386
In these acts of killing,
did you ever have a lapse of memory...

1801
01:58:15,469 --> 01:58:18,389
...like when you killed Barney Quill?
- No, sir.

1802
01:58:18,472 --> 01:58:21,475
- Ever have a memory lapse during battle?
- No, sir.

1803
01:58:21,559 --> 01:58:23,978
Were you ever submitted
to a constant barrage...

1804
01:58:24,061 --> 01:58:26,855
...in a sweat for many hours,
constantly under attack?

1805
01:58:27,022 --> 01:58:28,107
Many times.

1806
01:58:28,190 --> 01:58:30,401
Ever treated for shellshock
or war neurosis?

1807
01:58:30,484 --> 01:58:31,610
No, sir.

1808
01:58:31,694 --> 01:58:35,739
Did you ever experience
any unusual mental state during the war?

1809
01:58:36,198 --> 01:58:38,784
- I remember having one great urge.
- What was that?

1810
01:58:38,867 --> 01:58:40,661
To get the hell out and go home.

1811
01:58:42,413 --> 01:58:46,834
You would do well to consider
the seriousness of the situation you are in.

1812
01:58:46,917 --> 01:58:48,168
Sorry, Your Honour.

1813
01:58:48,252 --> 01:58:50,004
I sympathise with the lieutenant.

1814
01:58:50,087 --> 01:58:53,549
I expect he has the same feeling
about getting out of jail.

1815
01:58:53,841 --> 01:58:59,138
The point is that during your service there
was never a record of mental disturbance.

1816
01:58:59,221 --> 01:59:03,183
- You were always completely sane?
- Yes, sir, that's right.

1817
01:59:03,726 --> 01:59:05,144
No more questions.

1818
01:59:05,227 --> 01:59:06,645
No redirect, Your Honour.

1819
01:59:06,729 --> 01:59:09,189
Step down, please. Call your next witness.

1820
01:59:09,273 --> 01:59:11,817
We call Laura Manion to the stand.

1821
01:59:24,079 --> 01:59:26,707
- Up these stairs to the right.
- Thanks.

1822
01:59:33,922 --> 01:59:38,010
How long after you told your husband
what happened did he leave the trailer?

1823
01:59:38,302 --> 01:59:42,097
I don't know exactly.
Everything was kind of fuzzy.

1824
01:59:42,431 --> 01:59:46,685
I was faint and I lay down on the bed,
he sat beside me.

1825
01:59:47,060 --> 01:59:50,188
I vaguely remember
his getting up and going out.

1826
01:59:50,272 --> 01:59:54,818
I remember wondering if he was going
for a doctor, and then he came back in.

1827
01:59:55,193 --> 01:59:58,238
It seemed like just a few seconds,
but it must've been longer.

1828
01:59:58,322 --> 02:00:00,198
I must've gone to sleep.

1829
02:00:00,490 --> 02:00:04,786
When he came back in, he sat on the bed
and he had a gun in his hand.

1830
02:00:05,954 --> 02:00:08,332
And I said, "What are you going to do?"

1831
02:00:08,749 --> 02:00:13,962
He said, "I think I've already done it.
I think I've killed Barney Quill."

1832
02:00:14,087 --> 02:00:17,299
Are you sure he didn't say,
"I've killed Barney Quill"?

1833
02:00:17,716 --> 02:00:21,970
No. I remember distinctly:
"I think I've killed Barney Quill."

1834
02:00:22,345 --> 02:00:24,264
Then what did you do?

1835
02:00:24,347 --> 02:00:28,185
I put my arms around him
and began to cry.

1836
02:00:28,685 --> 02:00:31,646
I said, "You'd better go to Mr. Lemon."

1837
02:00:31,730 --> 02:00:33,774
My husband said, "I forgot about that."

1838
02:00:33,857 --> 02:00:36,818
What did he mean? Forgot about what?

1839
02:00:36,985 --> 02:00:40,113
He meant he'd forgotten
Mr. Lemon was a deputy sheriff.

1840
02:00:40,405 --> 02:00:44,075
And he said,
"Yes, I'll go turn myself in to Mr. Lemon."

1841
02:00:45,076 --> 02:00:47,412
I have no other direct questions
at this time.

1842
02:00:47,996 --> 02:00:51,208
But, since I'm sure it's difficult
to visualise the part...

1843
02:00:51,291 --> 02:00:53,376
...a little dog played on this night...

1844
02:00:53,793 --> 02:00:57,714
...I should like to show the court
this remarkable little animal.

1845
02:00:57,797 --> 02:00:59,674
Do the People object?

1846
02:00:59,758 --> 02:01:01,593
I'm sure if we did...

1847
02:01:01,718 --> 02:01:05,555
...Mr. Biegler would declare
that we're haters of small, furry animals.

1848
02:01:05,680 --> 02:01:09,100
A creature that cannot talk
will be a welcome relief.

1849
02:01:09,184 --> 02:01:11,144
Bring in the dog.

1850
02:01:11,478 --> 02:01:12,520
Thank you, sir.

1851
02:01:12,896 --> 02:01:15,774
Will the deputy bring in the dog, please?

1852
02:01:29,287 --> 02:01:31,623
Now, you can put him right there.

1853
02:01:32,874 --> 02:01:34,042
Come on.

1854
02:01:36,503 --> 02:01:38,213
That's a boy!

1855
02:01:39,464 --> 02:01:43,385
Now, I'll ask Mrs. Manion
to bring a flashlight for the dog.

1856
02:01:54,145 --> 02:01:58,149
I'll ask the court to notice
that the dog turned on the light.

1857
02:02:07,700 --> 02:02:10,912
It's easy to see that Muff doesn't know
who his enemies are.

1858
02:02:10,995 --> 02:02:14,415
Remove the dog, please.
Witness will resume the stand.

1859
02:02:14,499 --> 02:02:15,917
There we go, Muff.

1860
02:02:19,254 --> 02:02:23,341
Mrs. Manion, may I congratulate you
on your well-trained pet.

1861
02:02:23,633 --> 02:02:25,677
May I also say that I'm pleased to see...

1862
02:02:25,760 --> 02:02:29,055
...you are not hiding your lovely hair
under a hat.

1863
02:02:29,514 --> 02:02:32,725
Is the assistant attorney general
from Lansing pitching woo...

1864
02:02:32,809 --> 02:02:34,978
...or is he going to cross-examine?

1865
02:02:35,144 --> 02:02:36,437
Let's get on with it.

1866
02:02:36,521 --> 02:02:38,940
What was your occupation
before you were married?

1867
02:02:39,065 --> 02:02:40,400
Housewife.

1868
02:02:40,525 --> 02:02:41,901
You were married before?

1869
02:02:41,985 --> 02:02:43,277
Yes, once.

1870
02:02:43,361 --> 02:02:45,697
I suppose your first husband died?

1871
02:02:46,739 --> 02:02:47,782
No.

1872
02:02:47,865 --> 02:02:50,910
Did you divorce your first husband
to marry Lt. Manion?

1873
02:02:50,994 --> 02:02:55,081
If counsel wants to know the grounds
for her divorce, let him ask that question.

1874
02:02:55,206 --> 02:02:58,042
- What were they?
- Mental cruelty.

1875
02:02:58,376 --> 02:03:02,505
Naturally. How long after your divorce
did you marry Lt. Manion?

1876
02:03:03,131 --> 02:03:04,424
I'm not sure.

1877
02:03:04,507 --> 02:03:07,218
May I refresh the witness' memory
for Mr. Dancer?

1878
02:03:07,301 --> 02:03:08,428
By all means.

1879
02:03:08,928 --> 02:03:13,641
I believe she told me that they were
married three days after the divorce.

1880
02:03:14,016 --> 02:03:16,310
- Is that correct, Mrs. Manion?
- Yes.

1881
02:03:16,811 --> 02:03:19,480
Then unless yours was
a whirlwind courtship...

1882
02:03:19,564 --> 02:03:22,316
...you must've known Lt. Manion
before your divorce.

1883
02:03:22,775 --> 02:03:23,818
Yes.

1884
02:03:24,694 --> 02:03:27,947
Mrs. Manion,
what is your religious affiliation?

1885
02:03:28,573 --> 02:03:30,158
I'm a Catholic.

1886
02:03:30,575 --> 02:03:31,909
A Catholic in good standing?

1887
02:03:32,285 --> 02:03:33,786
No, the divorce, you know.

1888
02:03:33,870 --> 02:03:36,789
You were ex-communicated
because of the divorce?

1889
02:03:36,873 --> 02:03:37,915
Yes.

1890
02:03:38,541 --> 02:03:40,877
Wouldn't you say that a Catholic...

1891
02:03:40,960 --> 02:03:45,006
...who can blithely ignore
one of the cardinal rules of her Church...

1892
02:03:45,089 --> 02:03:48,467
...could also easily ignore
an oath taken on one of its artefacts?

1893
02:03:48,551 --> 02:03:50,553
Say, an oath taken on a rosary?

1894
02:03:52,722 --> 02:03:54,640
I don't think that's true.

1895
02:03:54,765 --> 02:03:58,728
Wouldn't there be some doubt
about the integrity of such a person?

1896
02:03:58,853 --> 02:04:02,857
I don't know. All I know is
the rosary means something to me.

1897
02:04:03,858 --> 02:04:04,900
I see.

1898
02:04:05,318 --> 02:04:07,695
I'll pass on to something else.

1899
02:04:08,070 --> 02:04:12,491
You testified that your husband came
home late on the night of the shooting.

1900
02:04:12,700 --> 02:04:15,202
Were you a little angry
about his being late?

1901
02:04:15,411 --> 02:04:17,079
I guess I was a little put out.

1902
02:04:17,163 --> 02:04:20,249
- Did you have an argument?
- Not much. A little.

1903
02:04:20,332 --> 02:04:23,961
When you left to go to the inn,
did your husband know you were going?

1904
02:04:24,378 --> 02:04:25,671
He was asleep.

1905
02:04:25,755 --> 02:04:30,718
Was part of your reason for going without
his knowledge because you were vexed?

1906
02:04:31,385 --> 02:04:34,847
I'd been ironing all day...

1907
02:04:35,139 --> 02:04:36,807
Yes, I guess that's true.

1908
02:04:36,891 --> 02:04:39,810
Counsel has deliberately cut off my view
of the witness.

1909
02:04:39,935 --> 02:04:44,023
I'm sorry, Mr. Biegler. I wouldn't interfere
with your signals to Mrs. Manion.

1910
02:04:44,106 --> 02:04:46,484
I object to the implication I was signalling.

1911
02:04:46,567 --> 02:04:49,445
This is the shabbiest courtroom trick
I've ever seen.

1912
02:04:49,528 --> 02:04:51,197
You haven't lived, Mr. Biegler.

1913
02:04:51,363 --> 02:04:53,574
I ask the court to rule on my objection.

1914
02:04:53,699 --> 02:04:58,287
Will you be careful not to place yourself
between Mr. Biegler and his witness?

1915
02:04:58,704 --> 02:05:00,164
Of course, Your Honour.

1916
02:05:00,456 --> 02:05:02,291
Anything else, Mr. Biegler?

1917
02:05:02,374 --> 02:05:07,588
You do it again, I'll punt you all the way
out into the middle of Lake Superior.

1918
02:05:09,089 --> 02:05:11,884
Gentlemen, this rowing has got to stop.

1919
02:05:12,426 --> 02:05:16,430
The next one of you that speaks out of turn
will have me to deal with.

1920
02:05:16,513 --> 02:05:18,641
Now, get on with your cross-examination.

1921
02:05:19,016 --> 02:05:22,019
Would you have gone to the inn
if your husband had been awake?

1922
02:05:22,269 --> 02:05:24,021
He would have gone with me.

1923
02:05:24,104 --> 02:05:25,648
Would you have gone alone?

1924
02:05:25,856 --> 02:05:29,777
- Not if he didn't want me to.
- Would he have not wanted you to?

1925
02:05:29,985 --> 02:05:32,404
I'm not sure.
I don't know how to answer that.

1926
02:05:32,654 --> 02:05:35,324
Had you ever gone
to the Thunder Bay Inn...

1927
02:05:35,407 --> 02:05:38,369
...or elsewhere in Thunder Bay,
alone at night?

1928
02:05:38,577 --> 02:05:40,245
Yes. Sometimes.

1929
02:05:40,579 --> 02:05:42,289
Did your husband know you were going?

1930
02:05:42,372 --> 02:05:47,503
Not always. He goes to sleep early
and sometimes I'm restless.

1931
02:05:47,753 --> 02:05:50,005
Where did you go on these occasions?

1932
02:05:50,089 --> 02:05:54,718
I'd take a walk by the lake,
or to the bingo place, maybe to the inn.

1933
02:05:55,344 --> 02:05:57,429
Did you ever go to meet another man?

1934
02:05:58,138 --> 02:06:00,557
No, I didn't. I never did that.

1935
02:06:00,766 --> 02:06:04,144
You mean to say a lovely woman
like yourself, attractive to men...

1936
02:06:04,561 --> 02:06:06,563
...lonely, restless, that you never...

1937
02:06:06,688 --> 02:06:09,858
Objection, the witness has answered
the question about other men.

1938
02:06:09,942 --> 02:06:12,611
Counsel is now making
a veiled suggestion to the jury.

1939
02:06:12,694 --> 02:06:15,322
I withdraw the question.

1940
02:06:16,031 --> 02:06:21,328
On these occasional excursions into the
night, did you always return home alone?

1941
02:06:21,870 --> 02:06:23,247
Of course.

1942
02:06:23,622 --> 02:06:27,125
You testified that the reason
you got into Barney Quill's car...

1943
02:06:27,209 --> 02:06:29,461
...was that you were afraid
to go home alone.

1944
02:06:29,544 --> 02:06:32,422
Why were you so frightened
on this particular night?

1945
02:06:32,506 --> 02:06:36,343
I said that it was because he told me
bears had been seen around.

1946
02:06:36,426 --> 02:06:39,972
Was this the first time you'd heard
that bears came around Thunder Bay...

1947
02:06:40,055 --> 02:06:43,392
...to pick up scraps?
Had you seen the bears before?

1948
02:06:43,475 --> 02:06:44,476
Yes.

1949
02:06:44,559 --> 02:06:47,187
This was just the first time
you were afraid of them?

1950
02:06:47,270 --> 02:06:49,231
No. I was always afraid of them.

1951
02:06:49,314 --> 02:06:52,776
This was just the first time
you were enough afraid to allow a man...

1952
02:06:52,859 --> 02:06:54,986
...to take you home after an evening prowl?

1953
02:06:55,112 --> 02:06:58,782
Objection. The use of the word "prowl"
is meant to mislead the jury.

1954
02:06:58,865 --> 02:07:00,951
- Sustained.
- I apologise, Mrs. Manion.

1955
02:07:02,035 --> 02:07:04,621
I didn't mean to imply
that you were a huntress.

1956
02:07:04,788 --> 02:07:07,207
Was this the first time
you were enough afraid...

1957
02:07:07,290 --> 02:07:10,710
...to allow a man to take you home
from one of your evening walks?

1958
02:07:12,796 --> 02:07:14,798
It wasn't just that. It was...

1959
02:07:14,881 --> 02:07:17,259
You should be able
to answer that straight off.

1960
02:07:17,384 --> 02:07:19,136
That's a simple enough question.

1961
02:07:19,261 --> 02:07:23,306
How can the witness answer straight off,
if counsel keeps interrupting the answer?

1962
02:07:23,431 --> 02:07:26,601
The witness seemed a little slow to me,
Mr. Biegler.

1963
02:07:26,726 --> 02:07:29,855
However, let her complete her answers
before you interrupt.

1964
02:07:30,313 --> 02:07:34,192
In any case, Mr. Biegler's objection
has given Mrs. Manion sufficient time...

1965
02:07:34,276 --> 02:07:37,445
...to think of an answer.
You've thought of one, haven't you?

1966
02:07:37,529 --> 02:07:39,656
What I was going to say was that...

1967
02:07:39,739 --> 02:07:44,035
...I didn't want to offend Mr. Quill
by making him think I didn't like him.

1968
02:07:44,244 --> 02:07:47,747
He'd been very pleasant to my husband
and me when we'd been in his bar.

1969
02:07:47,956 --> 02:07:49,833
That's very good. Very good indeed.

1970
02:07:50,041 --> 02:07:51,293
Your Honour, please.

1971
02:07:51,584 --> 02:07:55,797
The attorney for the People will reserve
his comments for the arguments.

1972
02:07:55,880 --> 02:07:58,425
I will ask you this question, Mrs. Manion:

1973
02:07:59,259 --> 02:08:03,596
Was this the first time you had been
in Barney Quill's car at night?

1974
02:08:07,183 --> 02:08:09,602
Mrs. Manion, did you hear the question?

1975
02:08:10,437 --> 02:08:11,855
Yes, I heard.

1976
02:08:12,731 --> 02:08:14,733
Yes, it was the first time.

1977
02:08:15,775 --> 02:08:18,153
Would you raise your voice a little?

1978
02:08:18,737 --> 02:08:21,030
I said it was the first time.

1979
02:08:23,992 --> 02:08:26,786
I'm quite concerned about the lost panties.

1980
02:08:26,870 --> 02:08:31,040
Would you describe this article
of clothing to the courtroom?

1981
02:08:31,332 --> 02:08:34,252
They were nylon and had lace up the sides.

1982
02:08:34,335 --> 02:08:38,756
There was a store label in them
from the Smartshop in Phoenix, Arizona.

1983
02:08:38,840 --> 02:08:40,383
What was their colour?

1984
02:08:40,592 --> 02:08:42,177
- I believe white.
- You believe?

1985
02:08:42,302 --> 02:08:44,846
I have white and pink.
They may have been pink.

1986
02:08:44,971 --> 02:08:48,975
You're not sure. Haven't you checked
to see which pair of panties is missing?

1987
02:08:49,684 --> 02:08:53,146
When your husband came home late
and you had this little spat...

1988
02:08:53,354 --> 02:08:55,273
...were you already dressed to go out?

1989
02:08:55,398 --> 02:08:56,941
- No.
- When did you dress?

1990
02:08:57,025 --> 02:08:58,568
After dinner. When he was asleep.

1991
02:08:58,651 --> 02:09:00,945
It's been stated
you were bare-legged in the bar.

1992
02:09:01,029 --> 02:09:02,739
- Is that true?
- Yes.

1993
02:09:02,822 --> 02:09:05,700
In your anger and haste
to get out of the trailer...

1994
02:09:05,783 --> 02:09:07,493
...perhaps you forgot your panties?

1995
02:09:07,577 --> 02:09:10,455
Objection. She testified
as to what she was wearing.

1996
02:09:10,538 --> 02:09:11,581
Sustained.

1997
02:09:11,664 --> 02:09:13,458
Do you always wear panties?

1998
02:09:13,541 --> 02:09:16,127
Your Honour,
I object to this line of questioning.

1999
02:09:16,210 --> 02:09:18,921
Now, it's immaterial
what she does all the time.

2000
02:09:19,005 --> 02:09:21,424
The night of the attack,
she was wearing panties.

2001
02:09:21,507 --> 02:09:23,426
That's all we're concerned with.

2002
02:09:23,551 --> 02:09:28,056
Mrs. Manion seems a little uncertain about
what kind of panties she was wearing.

2003
02:09:28,139 --> 02:09:29,766
Since they've not been found...

2004
02:09:29,891 --> 02:09:33,478
...I submit that it's possible
she wasn't wearing any and has forgotten.

2005
02:09:33,561 --> 02:09:34,979
That's all I'm getting at.

2006
02:09:35,063 --> 02:09:37,315
You may answer, Mrs. Manion.

2007
02:09:38,149 --> 02:09:40,151
Do you always wear panties?

2008
02:09:41,277 --> 02:09:42,528
No.

2009
02:09:42,945 --> 02:09:46,240
On what occasions don't you?
When you go out alone at night?

2010
02:09:46,908 --> 02:09:50,203
Objection. He claims to go after
one thing and goes after another.

2011
02:09:50,286 --> 02:09:52,330
I'll sustain the objection.

2012
02:09:52,413 --> 02:09:55,917
Strike out the last two questions
and Mrs. Manion's answers.

2013
02:09:56,000 --> 02:10:00,087
Now, Mr. Dancer, get off the panties.
You've done enough damage.

2014
02:10:00,546 --> 02:10:02,256
Yes, Your Honour.

2015
02:10:02,715 --> 02:10:06,344
Mrs. Manion,
is your husband a jealous man?

2016
02:10:06,677 --> 02:10:07,762
He loves me.

2017
02:10:07,887 --> 02:10:10,890
I'm sure of that,
but is he excessively jealous?

2018
02:10:11,057 --> 02:10:15,019
How can the witness answer that?
What's the norm of jealousy?

2019
02:10:15,228 --> 02:10:18,064
Can you put your question differently,
Mr. Dancer?

2020
02:10:18,189 --> 02:10:20,983
Has your husband ever struck you
in a jealous rage?

2021
02:10:21,108 --> 02:10:24,862
Mr. Dancer's fishing now.
What's the relevancy of this question?

2022
02:10:24,946 --> 02:10:26,948
The shoe is squeezing Mr. Biegler's foot.

2023
02:10:27,031 --> 02:10:31,035
In his own words, this isn't a debate,
it's a cross-examination in a murder trial.

2024
02:10:31,118 --> 02:10:33,454
Proceed, Mr. Dancer.

2025
02:10:34,455 --> 02:10:36,082
Mrs. Manion.

2026
02:10:37,458 --> 02:10:40,461
Did you ever go out socially
in Thunder Bay?

2027
02:10:40,795 --> 02:10:42,296
A few times.

2028
02:10:42,588 --> 02:10:44,757
When your husband's outfit moved there...

2029
02:10:44,840 --> 02:10:49,261
...didn't Mr. Quill throw a cocktail party
for the officers and their wives?

2030
02:10:49,345 --> 02:10:53,641
Didn't your husband strike
a young second lieutenant at this party?

2031
02:10:53,974 --> 02:10:56,268
There was a little scuffle. It wasn't much.

2032
02:10:56,435 --> 02:10:59,522
- What was it about?
- I'm not sure I remember.

2033
02:10:59,897 --> 02:11:03,401
- Were you too drunk to remember?
- No, I was not.

2034
02:11:05,694 --> 02:11:09,406
I think it was because the lieutenant
was cutting in too much...

2035
02:11:09,490 --> 02:11:11,200
...when I danced with my husband.

2036
02:11:11,283 --> 02:11:13,244
Shortly afterwards, on the veranda...

2037
02:11:13,327 --> 02:11:17,832
...didn't your husband slap you hard
enough so that you fell against the wall?

2038
02:11:19,166 --> 02:11:20,209
He was drinking.

2039
02:11:20,334 --> 02:11:23,629
- Wasn't it a jealous rage?
- I don't know.

2040
02:11:23,712 --> 02:11:26,006
- Do you remember why he struck you?
- Yes.

2041
02:11:26,090 --> 02:11:30,553
Wasn't he enraged because he thought
you'd encouraged this young lieutenant?

2042
02:11:30,636 --> 02:11:31,887
He might have thought so.

2043
02:11:31,971 --> 02:11:33,722
There are witnesses to this.

2044
02:11:33,806 --> 02:11:36,183
I'll ask you again,
wasn't this a jealous rage?

2045
02:11:36,308 --> 02:11:38,686
I guess you could call it that.

2046
02:11:39,979 --> 02:11:41,730
Now I'll ask you:

2047
02:11:43,607 --> 02:11:47,695
On the night of the shooting,
what did you swear?

2048
02:11:48,028 --> 02:11:50,906
What oath did you take on the rosary?

2049
02:11:51,532 --> 02:11:53,993
It was about Barney Quill raping me.

2050
02:11:54,118 --> 02:11:57,538
Why did you swear on the rosary
that he'd raped you?

2051
02:11:57,705 --> 02:12:00,165
For the reason that he gave:
I was hysterical.

2052
02:12:00,249 --> 02:12:02,167
That is why he asked you to swear.

2053
02:12:02,251 --> 02:12:04,169
- Why did you swear?
- So he'd believe me.

2054
02:12:04,253 --> 02:12:05,295
Why shouldn't he?

2055
02:12:05,379 --> 02:12:08,507
Objection. The reason for the rosary
has been established.

2056
02:12:08,590 --> 02:12:10,342
These questions are immaterial.

2057
02:12:10,426 --> 02:12:13,721
No, I think I'll take the answer, Mr. Biegler.

2058
02:12:13,804 --> 02:12:16,890
I'll ask you again.
Why shouldn't he believe you?

2059
02:12:19,435 --> 02:12:21,395
Because I wasn't making much sense.

2060
02:12:21,520 --> 02:12:23,647
Did he think you'd lie about such a thing?

2061
02:12:23,772 --> 02:12:27,109
Objection. Lt. Manion has already testified
as to what he thought.

2062
02:12:27,192 --> 02:12:28,402
Sustained.

2063
02:12:28,569 --> 02:12:32,823
Did your husband strike you that night?
Did he hit you that night?

2064
02:12:38,036 --> 02:12:41,456
He may have slapped me
because I was hysterical.

2065
02:12:41,540 --> 02:12:44,126
Didn't you swear to a lie
to stop him hitting you?

2066
02:12:44,209 --> 02:12:45,252
No. I didn't.

2067
02:12:45,544 --> 02:12:48,380
Didn't he beat you at the gate
upon your return from...

2068
02:12:48,463 --> 02:12:49,631
...lovers' lane with Quill?

2069
02:12:50,132 --> 02:12:53,802
Objection. She testified
she was beaten by Barney Quill.

2070
02:12:53,927 --> 02:12:57,097
- Quiet.
- No more questions.

2071
02:12:58,765 --> 02:13:01,310
I think the witness has had enough,
Your Honour.

2072
02:13:01,393 --> 02:13:02,978
The witness may step down.

2073
02:13:03,103 --> 02:13:05,606
We'll recess for lunch.

2074
02:13:06,607 --> 02:13:08,442
Recess until 1:00.

2075
02:13:11,862 --> 02:13:13,238
It's all right, you were fine.

2076
02:13:46,938 --> 02:13:48,482
Dr. Smith?

2077
02:13:49,191 --> 02:13:50,650
I've come to meet you, sir.

2078
02:13:50,734 --> 02:13:51,860
My name is...

2079
02:13:51,943 --> 02:13:53,278
Sorry, you're mistaken.

2080
02:13:53,361 --> 02:13:56,698
Maybe I'm the one you're looking for.
Are you Mr. Biegler?

2081
02:13:56,781 --> 02:13:59,326
No, I'm his associate in the case.

2082
02:13:59,409 --> 02:14:00,869
Don't tell me you're Dr. Smith?

2083
02:14:00,952 --> 02:14:02,370
That's me.

2084
02:14:02,496 --> 02:14:04,206
The Army psychiatrist?

2085
02:14:04,581 --> 02:14:06,666
Maybe you expected me to be in uniform.

2086
02:14:07,083 --> 02:14:08,168
No.

2087
02:14:09,211 --> 02:14:11,463
I didn't expect anybody so young.

2088
02:14:12,005 --> 02:14:13,381
I'm forty.

2089
02:14:14,758 --> 02:14:18,345
I sort of hoped you'd have a beard
and wear a monocle.

2090
02:14:21,431 --> 02:14:23,975
- Is that better?
- It helps.

2091
02:14:24,059 --> 02:14:26,645
You're on the stand this afternoon.

2092
02:14:28,939 --> 02:14:31,733
Have you formed an opinion
as to Frederick Manion's...

2093
02:14:31,816 --> 02:14:34,611
...mental and emotional state
when he killed Barney Quill?

2094
02:14:34,736 --> 02:14:36,446
- I have.
- And what is it?

2095
02:14:36,529 --> 02:14:39,532
He was temporarily insane
at the time of the shooting.

2096
02:14:39,658 --> 02:14:43,995
At that time, do you believe he was able
to distinguish right from wrong?

2097
02:14:44,162 --> 02:14:47,457
He may or may not have been.
It doesn't make much difference.

2098
02:14:47,832 --> 02:14:50,168
As clearly as you can...

2099
02:14:50,377 --> 02:14:53,963
...will you explain
Manion's temporary insanity?

2100
02:14:54,047 --> 02:14:56,758
It is known as "dissociative reaction."

2101
02:14:57,300 --> 02:15:02,055
A psychic shock which creates
an almost overwhelming tension...

2102
02:15:02,138 --> 02:15:04,933
...which the person in shock must alleviate.

2103
02:15:05,141 --> 02:15:07,769
In Lt. Manion's case, a soldier...

2104
02:15:07,852 --> 02:15:10,647
...it is only natural
that he would turn to action.

2105
02:15:10,730 --> 02:15:14,442
Only direct, simple action
against Barney Quill...

2106
02:15:14,526 --> 02:15:16,569
...would relieve this unbearable tension.

2107
02:15:17,028 --> 02:15:18,321
This is not uncommon.

2108
02:15:18,404 --> 02:15:21,741
For example, in combat,
some of the more remarkable heroics...

2109
02:15:21,825 --> 02:15:23,660
...take place in this state of mind.

2110
02:15:23,743 --> 02:15:27,705
Is there another name for this state
we might be more likely to recognise?

2111
02:15:27,789 --> 02:15:30,959
Yes, it has been known
as "irresistible impulse."

2112
02:15:31,751 --> 02:15:35,713
A man in the grip of irresistible impulse,
would he be likely to go...

2113
02:15:35,797 --> 02:15:39,759
...to his neighbour for advice,
or call up the police to come to his aid?

2114
02:15:39,926 --> 02:15:41,261
Completely incompatible.

2115
02:15:41,427 --> 02:15:45,890
Yes, but our man was able
to take out a gun and load it...

2116
02:15:45,974 --> 02:15:47,767
...before setting out to find Quill.

2117
02:15:47,850 --> 02:15:49,686
That was his conscious mind.

2118
02:15:49,769 --> 02:15:52,438
But if no gun were available,
he would've gone anyway.

2119
02:15:52,522 --> 02:15:56,275
How would a man look
in the grip of dissociative reaction?

2120
02:15:56,359 --> 02:16:00,405
He might appear to be deadly calm,
fiercely deliberate.

2121
02:16:01,280 --> 02:16:05,868
Would you describe his behaviour as being
like a mailman delivering the mail?

2122
02:16:05,952 --> 02:16:10,707
Yes. Like a mailman, he would have
a job to do and he would do it.

2123
02:16:11,833 --> 02:16:13,167
Your witness.

2124
02:16:14,377 --> 02:16:16,921
Did you find any psychosis
in Frederick Manion?

2125
02:16:17,004 --> 02:16:18,881
- I did not.
- Any neurosis?

2126
02:16:18,965 --> 02:16:21,134
I found no history of neurosis.

2127
02:16:21,259 --> 02:16:24,804
- Any history of delusion?
- None.

2128
02:16:24,887 --> 02:16:27,640
- Loss of memory?
- Not before this instance.

2129
02:16:29,142 --> 02:16:30,768
Can you spot Mary Pilant?

2130
02:16:31,853 --> 02:16:35,731
She didn't come back after lunch.
I think you'd better give up on that one.

2131
02:16:36,566 --> 02:16:39,569
Doctor, you stated that the defendant
might or might not...

2132
02:16:39,694 --> 02:16:42,363
...have been able to distinguish
right from wrong...

2133
02:16:42,446 --> 02:16:44,615
...but it wouldn't have made a difference.

2134
02:16:44,699 --> 02:16:46,534
- Is that what you said?
- Approximately.

2135
02:16:46,617 --> 02:16:50,538
So, at the time of the shooting,
he could have known the difference?

2136
02:16:50,621 --> 02:16:52,456
He might have, yes.

2137
02:16:52,540 --> 02:16:54,000
Dr. Smith...

2138
02:16:54,250 --> 02:16:59,213
...if the defendant could have known
what he was doing and that it was wrong...

2139
02:16:59,297 --> 02:17:02,133
...how can you testify
that he was legally insane?

2140
02:17:02,216 --> 02:17:04,635
I'm not saying he was legally insane.

2141
02:17:04,719 --> 02:17:08,222
I'm saying that in his condition
it wouldn't have made a difference...

2142
02:17:08,306 --> 02:17:12,059
...whether he knew right from wrong.
He would still have shot Quill.

2143
02:17:12,310 --> 02:17:14,228
Dr. Smith...

2144
02:17:14,312 --> 02:17:18,357
...are you willing to rest your testimony
in this case on this opinion?

2145
02:17:18,441 --> 02:17:19,817
Yes, I am.

2146
02:17:21,527 --> 02:17:24,363
Your Honour,
I'd like to ask for a short recess.

2147
02:17:24,447 --> 02:17:27,783
We would like to meet with Mr. Biegler
and the court in chambers.

2148
02:17:27,867 --> 02:17:30,494
- Mr. Biegler?
- Glad to oblige, Your Honour.

2149
02:17:31,120 --> 02:17:33,914
Short recess. The jury will remain.

2150
02:17:45,551 --> 02:17:51,223
Someday I'm going to horrify tradition
and lay a dense cloud of tobacco smoke...

2151
02:17:51,307 --> 02:17:53,392
...in that hallowed courtroom.

2152
02:17:53,642 --> 02:17:56,061
What's on your mind, Mr. Dancer?

2153
02:17:56,187 --> 02:18:00,232
In view of Dr. Smith's testimony,
the defence might like to change their plea.

2154
02:18:00,316 --> 02:18:03,235
- Change it to what?
- Guilty, of course.

2155
02:18:03,319 --> 02:18:04,904
No, we'll still go for broke.

2156
02:18:05,613 --> 02:18:09,909
No one's considered nuts
unless he didn't know right from wrong.

2157
02:18:09,992 --> 02:18:14,496
- Why don't you get this over with?
- Your Honour, would you turn to page 486?

2158
02:18:14,788 --> 02:18:16,040
What's that?

2159
02:18:16,582 --> 02:18:18,876
Appears to be a law book, Mr. Lodwick.

2160
02:18:20,753 --> 02:18:22,838
I'm sorry, Your Honour.

2161
02:18:22,922 --> 02:18:25,215
I make those to help me think sometimes.

2162
02:18:25,382 --> 02:18:28,052
- For perch?
- No, it's for frogs.

2163
02:18:28,135 --> 02:18:29,970
What case is he citing?

2164
02:18:30,304 --> 02:18:32,765
We gig frogs
down in my part of the country.

2165
02:18:32,848 --> 02:18:33,932
It's the same up here.

2166
02:18:34,016 --> 02:18:37,061
I'm a trout man,
but this is a new wrinkle I'm gonna try.

2167
02:18:37,144 --> 02:18:38,979
They do it a lot down in the bayou.

2168
02:18:39,063 --> 02:18:42,816
The idea is to get a great big long pole
and a 10-pound line.

2169
02:18:42,900 --> 02:18:45,611
Just drift along a high bank in a boat.

2170
02:18:46,487 --> 02:18:51,200
Then you see that great big old bullfrog
in a crevice, and you float this along...

2171
02:18:51,325 --> 02:18:54,828
...in front of him
and that old tongue snaps out.

2172
02:18:54,912 --> 02:18:56,538
You got frog's legs for supper.

2173
02:18:56,622 --> 02:18:57,956
I'll be darned.

2174
02:18:58,040 --> 02:18:59,625
Keep it. Try it sometime.

2175
02:18:59,708 --> 02:19:01,460
Thanks. I will.

2176
02:19:02,002 --> 02:19:03,796
486.

2177
02:19:05,047 --> 02:19:09,218
- What is it, Your Honour?
- People versus Durfee, 1886.

2178
02:19:10,135 --> 02:19:12,137
Looks like a precedent.

2179
02:19:12,346 --> 02:19:14,473
Would you like to read it, Mr. Dancer?

2180
02:19:15,432 --> 02:19:19,520
No, thank you. I think I recall the case.

2181
02:19:20,145 --> 02:19:24,358
We're hooked, like the frog.

2182
02:19:27,819 --> 02:19:30,739
Dr. Harcourt, where did you receive
your university training?

2183
02:19:30,822 --> 02:19:32,741
Johns Hopkins in Baltimore, Maryland.

2184
02:19:32,824 --> 02:19:34,868
And where do you practise now?

2185
02:19:34,952 --> 02:19:38,872
I'm the medical superintendent
of the Bonder State Hospital for the insane.

2186
02:19:38,956 --> 02:19:43,835
It's been stated that dissociative reaction
or irresistible impulse...

2187
02:19:44,002 --> 02:19:46,838
...is not uncommon
among soldiers in combat.

2188
02:19:46,922 --> 02:19:49,675
- Do you agree with that statement?
- I do.

2189
02:19:49,758 --> 02:19:51,677
But not as it was put by Dr. Smith.

2190
02:19:51,760 --> 02:19:53,512
Where would you depart from Dr. Smith?

2191
02:19:53,595 --> 02:19:57,516
Dissociative reaction is not something
that comes out of the blue...

2192
02:19:57,599 --> 02:19:59,601
...and disappears as quickly.

2193
02:19:59,685 --> 02:20:03,855
It can only occur,
even among soldiers in combat...

2194
02:20:03,980 --> 02:20:07,734
...if the individual has a psychoneurotic
condition of long standing.

2195
02:20:08,110 --> 02:20:11,196
It has been testified here
that a psychiatric examination...

2196
02:20:11,279 --> 02:20:14,282
...of the defendant showed
no evidence of neurosis...

2197
02:20:14,366 --> 02:20:16,743
...and no history of dissociative reaction.

2198
02:20:16,827 --> 02:20:20,038
You've also heard it testified
that the defendant's behaviour...

2199
02:20:20,122 --> 02:20:23,375
...on the night of the shooting
was cool and direct.

2200
02:20:23,625 --> 02:20:27,003
- As an observer, do you remember this?
- Yes.

2201
02:20:27,504 --> 02:20:30,382
Have you formed an opinion
about the defendant's sanity...

2202
02:20:30,465 --> 02:20:32,050
...on the night of the shooting?

2203
02:20:32,175 --> 02:20:33,635
Yes. I'm of the opinion...

2204
02:20:33,718 --> 02:20:36,721
...that he was in sufficient possession
of his faculties...

2205
02:20:36,805 --> 02:20:39,474
...so he was not dominated
by his unconscious mind.

2206
02:20:39,558 --> 02:20:43,186
In other words, he was not in the grip
of irresistible impulse.

2207
02:20:43,395 --> 02:20:44,896
In my opinion, he was not.

2208
02:20:44,980 --> 02:20:46,147
Your witness.

2209
02:20:46,314 --> 02:20:51,528
Psychiatry is an effort to probe into
the dark, undiscovered world of the mind.

2210
02:20:51,778 --> 02:20:55,156
In there, the world might be round,
it could be square.

2211
02:20:55,365 --> 02:20:59,244
Your opinion could be wrong, Dr. Smith's
opinion could be right, is that true?

2212
02:20:59,327 --> 02:21:01,746
I'd be a poor doctor
if I didn't agree with that.

2213
02:21:01,913 --> 02:21:04,708
But, I believe my opinion to be right.

2214
02:21:05,375 --> 02:21:07,794
Might you have changed your opinion...

2215
02:21:07,877 --> 02:21:10,338
...if you'd examined the defendant
like Dr. Smith?

2216
02:21:11,423 --> 02:21:12,590
I don't believe so.

2217
02:21:12,882 --> 02:21:15,802
But Smith's opinion was made
under better circumstances?

2218
02:21:16,177 --> 02:21:18,888
If you mean that he was able
to examine the man, yes.

2219
02:21:19,097 --> 02:21:20,890
Yes. Thank you, Doctor.

2220
02:21:20,974 --> 02:21:24,102
That's all, Dr. Harcourt.
Is there more rebuttal?

2221
02:21:24,436 --> 02:21:26,396
We're over a barrel, Mitch.

2222
02:21:26,771 --> 02:21:28,690
We have to use him.

2223
02:21:29,524 --> 02:21:31,735
We call Duane Miller to the stand.

2224
02:21:32,110 --> 02:21:34,112
Will the sheriff bring in the witness?

2225
02:21:40,618 --> 02:21:41,995
What can he tell?

2226
02:21:43,204 --> 02:21:44,497
Nothing.

2227
02:21:45,707 --> 02:21:47,459
He can't tell anything.

2228
02:21:58,595 --> 02:21:59,846
Raise your right hand.

2229
02:21:59,929 --> 02:22:01,931
Do you swear the testimony you give...

2230
02:22:02,015 --> 02:22:05,185
...shall be the truth, the whole truth
and nothing but the truth?

2231
02:22:05,268 --> 02:22:06,311
I do.

2232
02:22:09,022 --> 02:22:10,523
State your name, please.

2233
02:22:10,607 --> 02:22:13,192
Duane Miller. Most folks call me Duke.

2234
02:22:13,276 --> 02:22:15,069
Where do you presently reside?

2235
02:22:15,445 --> 02:22:17,488
Across the alley, in the jail.

2236
02:22:17,572 --> 02:22:19,490
You know the defendant, Lt. Manion?

2237
02:22:19,866 --> 02:22:22,744
I got to know him recently.
His cell's next to mine.

2238
02:22:22,869 --> 02:22:25,163
When was your last conversation?

2239
02:22:25,747 --> 02:22:28,916
Except for "hello" this morning,
it was last night.

2240
02:22:29,167 --> 02:22:31,461
Did you discuss his trial last night?

2241
02:22:31,544 --> 02:22:32,670
Yeah, some.

2242
02:22:32,754 --> 02:22:35,923
Would you tell the court
what Lt. Manion said about the trial?

2243
02:22:36,007 --> 02:22:38,926
I said, "Are things looking up, Lieutenant?"

2244
02:22:39,761 --> 02:22:42,472
He said, "I got it made, buster."

2245
02:22:42,722 --> 02:22:46,893
He said, "I fooled my lawyer,
I fooled that head-shrinker...

2246
02:22:47,101 --> 02:22:49,604
"... l'm gonna fool
those corn-cobbers on the jury."

2247
02:22:49,812 --> 02:22:50,980
You're a liar!

2248
02:22:51,064 --> 02:22:53,441
A lousy stinking liar!

2249
02:22:57,570 --> 02:23:00,031
I apologise for my client, Your Honour.

2250
02:23:00,531 --> 02:23:04,076
His outburst is almost excusable
since the prosecution has seen fit...

2251
02:23:04,160 --> 02:23:08,206
...to put a felon on the stand to testify
against an officer in the U.S. Army.

2252
02:23:08,331 --> 02:23:12,043
I don't know who is the worst offender:
Manion or his lawyer.

2253
02:23:12,502 --> 02:23:14,504
We're close to the end.

2254
02:23:14,754 --> 02:23:19,842
In the name of heaven, let's have peace
and courtesy for these last few hours.

2255
02:23:20,468 --> 02:23:24,639
Mr. Dancer, you will continue
your interrogation without comment.

2256
02:23:25,431 --> 02:23:28,726
Mr. Biegler, you will not sound off
at every opportunity.

2257
02:23:28,851 --> 02:23:31,687
The defendant will remain seated
and keep his mouth shut.

2258
02:23:31,771 --> 02:23:34,065
- Now, go ahead.
- Mr. Miller.

2259
02:23:34,440 --> 02:23:36,984
Are you certain that Lt. Manion said:

2260
02:23:37,276 --> 02:23:40,363
- "I've got it made, buster"?
- That's what he said.

2261
02:23:40,446 --> 02:23:43,199
- Did Lt. Manion say anything else?
- Yes, sir.

2262
02:23:43,658 --> 02:23:46,285
He said when he got out,
the first thing he'd do...

2263
02:23:46,369 --> 02:23:49,121
...was kick that bitch
from here to kingdom come.

2264
02:23:50,414 --> 02:23:53,125
- To whom was he referring?
- To his wife.

2265
02:23:54,293 --> 02:23:55,753
Your witness, Mr. Biegler.

2266
02:23:56,879 --> 02:23:59,173
- What're you in jail for, Mr. Miller?
- Arson.

2267
02:23:59,256 --> 02:24:01,258
I copped out
and I'm waiting for a sentence.

2268
02:24:01,342 --> 02:24:03,344
How many other crimes
have you committed?

2269
02:24:03,636 --> 02:24:06,639
I was in reform school when I was a kid,
but that's all.

2270
02:24:07,390 --> 02:24:09,850
I'd like to see this man's criminal record.

2271
02:24:10,101 --> 02:24:12,019
Do you have his record?

2272
02:24:12,228 --> 02:24:13,270
Yes, sir.

2273
02:24:14,480 --> 02:24:15,773
Here it is.

2274
02:24:19,110 --> 02:24:23,739
Your record shows you've been in prison
six times in three different states.

2275
02:24:24,573 --> 02:24:29,745
Been in three times for arson,
twice for assault, once for larceny.

2276
02:24:32,206 --> 02:24:35,292
It also shows you've done
short stretches in four city jails...

2277
02:24:35,376 --> 02:24:39,129
...on charges of indecent exposure,
window-peeping...

2278
02:24:39,213 --> 02:24:41,799
...perjury and disorderly conduct.

2279
02:24:43,133 --> 02:24:44,885
Is this your true record?

2280
02:24:46,053 --> 02:24:47,596
Them things are never right.

2281
02:24:47,805 --> 02:24:50,182
How did you get the ear
of the prosecution...

2282
02:24:50,307 --> 02:24:53,769
...to tell them about this conversation
you had with Lt. Manion?

2283
02:24:53,852 --> 02:24:56,522
- The D.A. Was taking us to his office.
- Taking who?

2284
02:24:56,772 --> 02:24:58,232
Us prisoners, in the jail.

2285
02:24:58,357 --> 02:25:00,067
All at once, or one at a time?

2286
02:25:00,234 --> 02:25:01,527
One at a time.

2287
02:25:01,819 --> 02:25:04,822
Him and that other lawyer
took us to his office...

2288
02:25:04,905 --> 02:25:07,157
...and asked us questions about Lt. Manion.

2289
02:25:07,366 --> 02:25:10,995
Were you promised a lighter sentence
if you went on the witness stand?

2290
02:25:11,078 --> 02:25:13,580
- The People object...
- Overruled. Answer.

2291
02:25:13,706 --> 02:25:15,290
I wasn't promised anything.

2292
02:25:15,374 --> 02:25:17,209
You just thought it would help you...

2293
02:25:17,292 --> 02:25:19,753
...if you dreamed up this story
to please the D.A.

2294
02:25:19,878 --> 02:25:21,171
I didn't dream it up.

2295
02:25:21,255 --> 02:25:23,507
- You're sure that's what he said?
- I'm sure.

2296
02:25:23,632 --> 02:25:25,926
As sure as you were about your record?

2297
02:25:26,552 --> 02:25:28,721
I guess I kind of goofed on that one.

2298
02:25:31,014 --> 02:25:36,145
I don't feel I can dignify this creature
with any more questions.

2299
02:25:36,520 --> 02:25:37,938
Take the witness away.

2300
02:25:39,022 --> 02:25:40,899
Would you like a conference
with your client?

2301
02:25:40,983 --> 02:25:43,902
I can see how the last witness
was quite a surprise.

2302
02:25:44,361 --> 02:25:46,530
No, we don't need a conference.

2303
02:25:46,738 --> 02:25:49,283
I'll recall Lt. Manion to the stand right now.

2304
02:25:57,624 --> 02:26:00,586
You've heard the testimony of this Miller.

2305
02:26:01,837 --> 02:26:03,380
Is any part of it true?

2306
02:26:03,547 --> 02:26:04,715
None.

2307
02:26:05,591 --> 02:26:09,803
Do you have any idea why he might come
here with a tale like that?

2308
02:26:10,012 --> 02:26:11,054
No, sir.

2309
02:26:13,348 --> 02:26:15,475
Have you ever talked with this man?

2310
02:26:15,726 --> 02:26:16,768
Yes.

2311
02:26:17,769 --> 02:26:19,313
What did you talk about?

2312
02:26:21,398 --> 02:26:23,150
Nothing important.

2313
02:26:23,650 --> 02:26:27,112
Certainly nothing about my personal life
or my feelings.

2314
02:26:28,030 --> 02:26:29,781
That's all I wanted to know.

2315
02:26:29,865 --> 02:26:31,533
Lt. Manion.

2316
02:26:32,284 --> 02:26:37,164
Have you ever had any trouble with Miller?

2317
02:26:38,874 --> 02:26:41,460
What do you mean?
An argument, something like that?

2318
02:26:41,752 --> 02:26:45,547
Did you ever attack Miller?
Physically attack him?

2319
02:26:46,798 --> 02:26:49,342
Your lawyer can't answer the question
for you.

2320
02:26:49,468 --> 02:26:51,344
Did you ever attack Miller?

2321
02:26:51,428 --> 02:26:53,847
I wouldn't call it an attack, exactly.

2322
02:26:54,055 --> 02:26:56,183
I pushed his head against the bars once.

2323
02:26:56,266 --> 02:26:59,269
- Why?
- He said something ugly about my wife.

2324
02:26:59,728 --> 02:27:03,023
Do you remember pushing or bumping
his head against the bars?

2325
02:27:03,315 --> 02:27:05,275
Sure. I just told you.

2326
02:27:05,442 --> 02:27:07,652
Then this was not dissociative reaction?

2327
02:27:07,736 --> 02:27:10,614
- The defendant isn't qualified to answer.
- Sustained.

2328
02:27:10,697 --> 02:27:12,365
Lt. Manion.

2329
02:27:12,824 --> 02:27:16,870
Wasn't your action against Quill
the same as your action against Miller...

2330
02:27:16,953 --> 02:27:20,081
...and against the lieutenant
you struck at the cocktail party?

2331
02:27:20,207 --> 02:27:24,294
All in the heat of anger, with a wilful,
conscious desire to hurt or kill?

2332
02:27:24,878 --> 02:27:27,088
I don't remember my action against Quill.

2333
02:27:28,340 --> 02:27:31,676
How long had you known
your wife was running around with Quill?

2334
02:27:33,261 --> 02:27:35,347
I never knew anything like that.

2335
02:27:36,514 --> 02:27:37,724
I trust my wife.

2336
02:27:38,975 --> 02:27:41,728
I suppose you beat her up occasionally
just for fun?

2337
02:27:41,811 --> 02:27:44,773
Nothing has been established
to permit such a question.

2338
02:27:45,190 --> 02:27:47,400
He implies things
without getting to the point.

2339
02:27:47,525 --> 02:27:50,945
Let him ask, "Did he ever beat his wife?"

2340
02:27:51,029 --> 02:27:52,697
I'll sustain the objection.

2341
02:27:52,906 --> 02:27:55,450
Would you like to rephrase your question?

2342
02:27:57,035 --> 02:27:58,578
No, thank you.

2343
02:27:59,454 --> 02:28:00,997
I've finished.

2344
02:28:01,289 --> 02:28:02,999
Then I'll ask it.

2345
02:28:03,124 --> 02:28:06,586
Did you ever beat your wife,
on the night of the shooting...

2346
02:28:06,711 --> 02:28:08,338
...or at any other time?
- No.

2347
02:28:08,421 --> 02:28:12,258
Is there any doubt in your mind
that Quill raped Mrs. Manion?

2348
02:28:12,342 --> 02:28:13,843
- No, sir.
- That's all.

2349
02:28:13,968 --> 02:28:15,303
Step down, Lieutenant.

2350
02:28:21,810 --> 02:28:24,270
- Are we hurt?
- We're hurt bad.

2351
02:28:24,646 --> 02:28:25,688
Paul.

2352
02:28:30,443 --> 02:28:34,197
I know time is pressing,
I don't want to ask for a recess.

2353
02:28:34,322 --> 02:28:36,199
I'd like to leave the courtroom briefly.

2354
02:28:36,324 --> 02:28:38,868
If it's important,
we can be at ease for a minute.

2355
02:28:39,202 --> 02:28:40,870
Thank you, sir.

2356
02:28:41,663 --> 02:28:43,790
This is highly irregular, Your Honour.

2357
02:28:44,082 --> 02:28:46,960
There's no reason
to make a federal case out of it.

2358
02:28:58,388 --> 02:28:59,764
Thank you, Your Honour.

2359
02:28:59,889 --> 02:29:02,058
We now have another rebuttal witness.

2360
02:29:02,141 --> 02:29:04,060
The defence calls Mary Pilant.

2361
02:29:04,143 --> 02:29:06,354
We must protest this whole affair.

2362
02:29:06,479 --> 02:29:09,524
The noble defence attorney
rushes to a secret conference...

2363
02:29:09,607 --> 02:29:12,568
...and the last-minute witness
is brought dramatically in.

2364
02:29:12,694 --> 02:29:15,863
It's obviously been rigged
to unduly excite the jury.

2365
02:29:15,947 --> 02:29:18,116
It's just another cornball trick.

2366
02:29:18,241 --> 02:29:21,536
Your Honour, I don't blame Mr. Dancer
for feeling put upon.

2367
02:29:21,619 --> 02:29:24,539
I'm just a humble country lawyer,
trying to do my best...

2368
02:29:24,622 --> 02:29:28,084
...against this brilliant prosecutor
from the big city of Lansing.

2369
02:29:28,334 --> 02:29:30,086
Swear the witness.

2370
02:29:31,003 --> 02:29:32,338
Raise your right hand.

2371
02:29:32,422 --> 02:29:34,465
Do you swear the testimony you give...

2372
02:29:34,549 --> 02:29:38,386
...shall be the truth, the whole truth
and nothing but the truth?

2373
02:29:38,553 --> 02:29:40,346
- I do.
- Sit down, please.

2374
02:29:43,724 --> 02:29:46,769
- Where do you live?
- At the Thunder Bay Inn, in Thunder Bay.

2375
02:29:46,853 --> 02:29:49,647
- How long have you lived there?
- For two years.

2376
02:29:50,273 --> 02:29:52,942
- What's your profession?
- I manage the inn.

2377
02:29:53,484 --> 02:29:54,902
Miss Pilant.

2378
02:29:55,027 --> 02:29:57,655
How is the laundry handled at the inn?

2379
02:29:57,864 --> 02:29:59,866
It's chuted down to the laundry room.

2380
02:29:59,949 --> 02:30:02,618
Where is that chute on the second floor?

2381
02:30:02,743 --> 02:30:04,787
Between Room 42 and 43.

2382
02:30:04,954 --> 02:30:06,330
Who lives in those rooms?

2383
02:30:06,414 --> 02:30:09,875
I live in 42, Mr. Quill lived in 43.

2384
02:30:10,126 --> 02:30:12,753
Would Mr. Quill,
coming up from the lobby...

2385
02:30:12,837 --> 02:30:16,299
...have to pass by that chute
on the way to his room?

2386
02:30:16,882 --> 02:30:18,676
- Yes.
- Would it be easy for him...

2387
02:30:18,759 --> 02:30:21,262
...to drop something
into that chute as he passed?

2388
02:30:21,345 --> 02:30:22,430
Yes.

2389
02:30:22,513 --> 02:30:25,933
Have you ever had occasion
to go down into the laundry?

2390
02:30:26,058 --> 02:30:29,603
Yes. Part of my job is to sort
various pieces of laundry...

2391
02:30:29,729 --> 02:30:32,189
...as they come out of the machines.

2392
02:30:32,273 --> 02:30:35,192
Would you tell us
what you found among the laundry...

2393
02:30:35,317 --> 02:30:37,528
...the day after Mr. Quill was killed?

2394
02:30:37,778 --> 02:30:39,947
I found a pair of woman's panties.

2395
02:30:40,156 --> 02:30:43,075
- What did you do with them?
- I threw them in the rag bin.

2396
02:30:43,200 --> 02:30:46,245
When did you learn the significance
of those panties?

2397
02:30:46,829 --> 02:30:49,457
Here. This morning in the courtroom.

2398
02:30:49,623 --> 02:30:52,209
- You went and got them out of the rag bin?
- Yes.

2399
02:30:52,293 --> 02:30:54,545
- Did you bring them with you?
- Yes.

2400
02:30:57,465 --> 02:31:03,220
I offer this article of lingerie
as "Exhibit Number 1" for the defence.

2401
02:31:03,345 --> 02:31:04,680
They're white.

2402
02:31:05,014 --> 02:31:07,141
They have lace up the side...

2403
02:31:07,933 --> 02:31:09,727
...and they're badly torn.

2404
02:31:10,019 --> 02:31:13,314
As if they'd been ripped apart
by powerful hands.

2405
02:31:13,939 --> 02:31:15,900
The label reads:

2406
02:31:17,276 --> 02:31:19,737
"Smartshop, Phoenix, Arizona."

2407
02:31:20,196 --> 02:31:23,490
If there is no objection,
the exhibit will be received in evidence.

2408
02:31:23,616 --> 02:31:24,658
That's all.

2409
02:31:24,742 --> 02:31:27,786
Did you ever talk to Mr. Lodwick
about Quill's death?

2410
02:31:28,078 --> 02:31:31,457
Yes. He came to the hotel several times
after Mr. Quill was killed.

2411
02:31:31,665 --> 02:31:34,960
Did you tell him you didn't believe
Quill raped Mrs. Manion?

2412
02:31:35,044 --> 02:31:36,086
Yes, I told him that.

2413
02:31:36,170 --> 02:31:39,965
- Did you ever talk to Mr. Biegler?
- Yes.

2414
02:31:40,049 --> 02:31:42,468
- In connection with Quill's death?
- Yes.

2415
02:31:42,593 --> 02:31:45,304
Did you tell him
you didn't believe Quill raped her?

2416
02:31:45,387 --> 02:31:47,640
- How many times did you talk with him?
- Twice.

2417
02:31:47,723 --> 02:31:49,808
- When was the last time?
- Last night.

2418
02:31:49,892 --> 02:31:51,518
Have you now changed your mind?

2419
02:31:51,644 --> 02:31:53,896
Do you now believe
Quill raped Mrs. Manion?

2420
02:31:54,355 --> 02:31:56,648
I don't know now. I think he might have.

2421
02:31:56,732 --> 02:31:58,942
When did you change your mind,
last night?

2422
02:31:59,068 --> 02:32:00,903
No, it was here, this morning.

2423
02:32:00,986 --> 02:32:03,364
When were you given the panties?
Last night?

2424
02:32:03,489 --> 02:32:06,867
- Just wait a minute!
- Use the proper form of objection.

2425
02:32:07,367 --> 02:32:11,080
On second thought, I don't object.
I'd like the jury to hear her answer.

2426
02:32:11,371 --> 02:32:12,748
The witness may answer.

2427
02:32:12,831 --> 02:32:16,877
No. I was not given the panties,
last night or any other time.

2428
02:32:16,960 --> 02:32:18,712
I found them exactly as I said.

2429
02:32:18,796 --> 02:32:21,632
Do you know that Quill
put the panties in the chute...

2430
02:32:21,757 --> 02:32:23,675
...or did you assume it?
- I assumed it.

2431
02:32:23,759 --> 02:32:26,261
Had you thought someone else
may have put them there?

2432
02:32:26,345 --> 02:32:28,472
Someone who wanted them found
in the laundry?

2433
02:32:28,555 --> 02:32:30,307
I hadn't thought of that.

2434
02:32:30,474 --> 02:32:34,144
In the grip of what Mr. Biegler
might call "irresistible impulse"...

2435
02:32:34,436 --> 02:32:36,230
...you rushed in with the panties...

2436
02:32:36,313 --> 02:32:40,526
...wanting to crucify Quill's character?
- No, it was my duty.

2437
02:32:40,651 --> 02:32:43,487
- Your pride was hurt, right?
- I don't know what you mean.

2438
02:32:43,570 --> 02:32:47,658
He's trying to confuse the witness.
Let him ask a question she understands.

2439
02:32:47,908 --> 02:32:51,787
Yes, Mr. Dancer. I, myself,
would like to know what you're driving at.

2440
02:32:51,995 --> 02:32:54,998
When you found the panties...

2441
02:32:55,374 --> 02:32:58,877
...was your first thought that Quill
might have raped Mrs. Manion...

2442
02:32:58,961 --> 02:33:02,339
...or was it that he might have been
stepping out with Mrs. Manion?

2443
02:33:02,839 --> 02:33:04,675
I don't know what he means.

2444
02:33:04,758 --> 02:33:06,927
Mr. Dancer, once again, I must ask you...

2445
02:33:07,010 --> 02:33:09,513
...to put straight questions to the witness.

2446
02:33:09,805 --> 02:33:12,349
Here is a straight question, Your Honour.

2447
02:33:13,350 --> 02:33:15,727
Miss Pilant,
were you Barney Quill's mistress?

2448
02:33:15,811 --> 02:33:17,646
No, I was not!

2449
02:33:17,729 --> 02:33:19,731
Everyone knows you were living with Quill.

2450
02:33:19,815 --> 02:33:21,900
That's not true. Barney Quill was...

2451
02:33:21,983 --> 02:33:23,527
Was what?

2452
02:33:24,444 --> 02:33:26,822
Barney Quill was what, Miss Pilant?

2453
02:33:28,698 --> 02:33:30,867
Barney Quill was my father.

2454
02:33:42,796 --> 02:33:44,214
No more questions.

2455
02:33:44,923 --> 02:33:46,424
That's all.

2456
02:33:47,843 --> 02:33:49,803
The witness may step down.

2457
02:33:50,178 --> 02:33:54,766
We will recess for 15 minutes, after which
we will hear the closing arguments.

2458
02:33:55,392 --> 02:33:59,396
If possible, I would like to charge the jury
before nightfall.

2459
02:34:15,120 --> 02:34:17,622
Think they're gonna stay out all night?

2460
02:34:32,554 --> 02:34:34,556
Can't somebody say something?

2461
02:34:37,100 --> 02:34:39,352
What do you want me to say,
Maida, darling?

2462
02:34:39,644 --> 02:34:41,354
Tell me we're gonna win.

2463
02:34:42,897 --> 02:34:46,609
I'm counting on getting that
promissory note from the lieutenant.

2464
02:34:46,860 --> 02:34:50,780
I hope we can borrow some money on it.
I need a new typewriter.

2465
02:34:51,322 --> 02:34:54,784
Half the time, the "P" and the "F"
don't strike on mine.

2466
02:34:55,535 --> 02:34:59,956
"Party of the first part" sometimes
comes out "arty o the irst art."

2467
02:35:00,832 --> 02:35:03,418
Doesn't make sense. It's embarrassing.

2468
02:35:03,626 --> 02:35:05,503
"Arty o the irst art"?

2469
02:35:06,087 --> 02:35:07,839
I kind of like that.

2470
02:35:08,464 --> 02:35:10,300
It has a ring to it.

2471
02:35:13,178 --> 02:35:16,264
Twelve people go off into a room.

2472
02:35:17,515 --> 02:35:19,267
Twelve different minds.

2473
02:35:19,559 --> 02:35:21,352
Twelve different hearts.

2474
02:35:21,811 --> 02:35:24,063
Twelve different walks of life.

2475
02:35:25,273 --> 02:35:28,776
Twelve sets of eyes,
ears, shapes and sizes.

2476
02:35:29,819 --> 02:35:34,949
These twelve people are asked to judge
another human being...

2477
02:35:35,325 --> 02:35:38,536
...as different from them
as they are from each other.

2478
02:35:39,203 --> 02:35:43,541
In their judgement, they must become
of one mind, unanimous.

2479
02:35:45,585 --> 02:35:49,714
It's one of the miracles of man's
disorganised soul that they can do it.

2480
02:35:50,548 --> 02:35:53,426
In most instances, do it right well.

2481
02:35:54,844 --> 02:35:57,388
God bless juries.

2482
02:35:58,765 --> 02:36:01,726
I don't know what I'd do
if I were on that jury.

2483
02:36:05,229 --> 02:36:07,190
I really don't know.

2484
02:36:08,733 --> 02:36:09,776
Do you?

2485
02:36:14,447 --> 02:36:16,282
I loved that, Pauly.

2486
02:36:16,532 --> 02:36:19,619
I loved that "humble country lawyer" bit.

2487
02:36:20,703 --> 02:36:22,872
You had Mr. Dancer dancing.

2488
02:36:24,332 --> 02:36:28,169
I'm afraid he got in the last dance.
That's the best summary I've ever heard.

2489
02:36:28,628 --> 02:36:31,130
I liked yours much better, Pauly.

2490
02:36:36,177 --> 02:36:37,720
Do you have to play that?

2491
02:36:37,845 --> 02:36:41,307
<i>Can't you play Danny Boy
or Sweet Isle of Innisfree?</i>

2492
02:36:55,154 --> 02:36:56,656
Paul Biegler's office.

2493
02:36:57,406 --> 02:36:58,991
Yes, sir. Right away.

2494
02:36:59,575 --> 02:37:00,826
They're ready.

2495
02:37:11,212 --> 02:37:13,005
Hey, sweetie!

2496
02:37:14,465 --> 02:37:16,050
Go on.

2497
02:37:17,259 --> 02:37:19,553
- The jury's coming in.
- Yeah, I heard.

2498
02:37:19,637 --> 02:37:22,390
You can tell my loving husband
I'll be in the car.

2499
02:37:22,598 --> 02:37:25,518
- You're sure he's gonna come out?
- Sure.

2500
02:37:25,601 --> 02:37:26,936
He's lucky.

2501
02:37:27,103 --> 02:37:29,438
Some people have all the luck.

2502
02:37:29,563 --> 02:37:33,400
You can tell him I'm waiting
to get kicked to kingdom come.

2503
02:37:33,943 --> 02:37:35,402
Hey, sweetie.

2504
02:37:36,028 --> 02:37:38,989
I have a souvenir for you.

2505
02:37:39,990 --> 02:37:41,867
You'd better keep that.

2506
02:37:42,076 --> 02:37:44,787
You might need it again sometime.
You never know.

2507
02:37:44,870 --> 02:37:46,497
No, you don't, do you?

2508
02:37:46,956 --> 02:37:48,916
I like you, Pauly.

2509
02:37:56,215 --> 02:37:59,802
I warn all those present
not to interrupt the taking of the verdict.

2510
02:37:59,885 --> 02:38:02,721
I will stop the proceedings
and clear the courtroom...

2511
02:38:02,805 --> 02:38:05,140
...if there is any demonstration.

2512
02:38:13,816 --> 02:38:15,734
Proceed, Mr. Cray.

2513
02:38:15,943 --> 02:38:18,362
Members of the jury, have you a verdict?

2514
02:38:18,612 --> 02:38:22,157
- If so, who will speak for you?
- We have. I'm the foreman.

2515
02:38:22,282 --> 02:38:24,326
The defendant will rise.

2516
02:38:26,870 --> 02:38:27,955
What is your verdict?

2517
02:38:28,038 --> 02:38:31,709
We find the defendant not guilty,
by reason of insanity.

2518
02:38:37,339 --> 02:38:39,675
Did Maida give you that promissory note?

2519
02:38:39,800 --> 02:38:43,220
Right here,
ready to be signed by our happy client.

2520
02:38:43,887 --> 02:38:47,474
I used to think the world looked better
through a glass of whiskey.

2521
02:38:47,558 --> 02:38:48,976
It doesn't.

2522
02:38:49,852 --> 02:38:51,478
I think I'll keep it this way.

2523
02:38:51,562 --> 02:38:53,105
It looks nice.

2524
02:38:53,856 --> 02:38:56,358
I got one good thing out of this case:

2525
02:38:57,568 --> 02:38:58,861
A new law partner.

2526
02:38:58,944 --> 02:39:01,113
If it's all right with him.

2527
02:39:01,488 --> 02:39:05,075
He'd be mighty proud to have his name
on a shingle with yours.

2528
02:39:35,063 --> 02:39:37,983
I guess you're looking for Lt. Manion,
aren't you?

2529
02:39:38,358 --> 02:39:40,319
He gave me this note for you.

2530
02:39:41,820 --> 02:39:43,739
Felt real sorry for Mrs. Manion.

2531
02:39:43,822 --> 02:39:45,407
She was crying.

2532
02:39:45,949 --> 02:39:47,659
Left a mess, didn't they?

2533
02:39:47,743 --> 02:39:49,786
We'd better get busy here.

2534
02:39:49,911 --> 02:39:51,538
"Dear Mr. Biegler:

2535
02:39:51,621 --> 02:39:53,665
"So sorry, but I had to leave suddenly.

2536
02:39:53,749 --> 02:39:56,168
"I was seized by an irresistible impulse.

2537
02:39:56,752 --> 02:39:58,462
"Frederick Manion."

2538
02:39:59,588 --> 02:40:02,466
How in the world
are we gonna face Maida?

2539
02:40:03,717 --> 02:40:04,843
Gin.

2540
02:40:05,427 --> 02:40:07,846
I knew there was something wrong
with that guy.

2541
02:40:07,971 --> 02:40:10,557
I never saw a gin-drinker yet
you could trust.

2542
02:40:11,767 --> 02:40:14,895
Partner, what do you say
we go and see our first client?

2543
02:40:15,061 --> 02:40:16,229
Who might that be?

2544
02:40:16,313 --> 02:40:19,608
Mary Pilant. We're going to administer
Barney Quill's estate.

2545
02:40:19,691 --> 02:40:23,195
Now, that's what I call
poetic justice for everybody.

2546
02:40:24,863 --> 02:40:25,906
Yeah.

2547
02:40:26,305 --> 02:40:32,349
