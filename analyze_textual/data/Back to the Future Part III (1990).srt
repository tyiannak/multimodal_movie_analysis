2
00:01:18,100 --> 00:01:19,100
Doc.

3
00:02:18,300 --> 00:02:20,600
Doc.

4
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:22,400
-Doc!
-What?

5
00:02:24,300 --> 00:02:26,300
Relax, Doc. It's me! It's Marty.

6
00:02:26,400 --> 00:02:28,800
It can't be.
I just sent you back to the future.

7
00:02:28,900 --> 00:02:32,000
You did send me back to the future,
but I'm back.

8
00:02:32,100 --> 00:02:34,000
I'm back from the future.

9
00:02:37,400 --> 00:02:38,800
Great Scott!

10
00:04:49,400 --> 00:04:53,200
Hey, kids, what time is it?
Howdy Doody time!

11
00:04:53,300 --> 00:04:56,900
"It's Howdy Doody time"
Great Scott!

12
00:05:06,200 --> 00:05:07,900
Howdy Doody time?

13
00:05:12,600 --> 00:05:16,700
Sunday, November 13, 1955, 7:01 a.m.

14
00:05:16,800 --> 00:05:20,200
Last night's time travel experiment
was apparently a complete success.

15
00:05:20,400 --> 00:05:22,600
Lightning struck the clock tower
at 10:04 p.m...

16
00:05:22,800 --> 00:05:25,000
...sending the necessary 1.21 gigawatts...

17
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:28,200
...into the time vehicle,
which vanished in a flash of light...

18
00:05:28,200 --> 00:05:32,500
...leaving a pair of fire trails behind.
I assumed Marty and the time vehicle...

19
00:05:32,600 --> 00:05:35,800
...were transported forward through time
to the year 1985.

20
00:05:36,200 --> 00:05:40,000
After that, I can't recall what happened.

21
00:05:40,100 --> 00:05:42,800
In fact, I don't even remember
how I got home.

22
00:05:42,900 --> 00:05:46,500
Perhaps the gigawatt discharge
and the temporal displacement field...

23
00:05:46,600 --> 00:05:50,000
...generated by the vehicle caused
a disruption of my own brain waves...

24
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:52,600
...resulting in a condition of momentary amnesia.

25
00:05:52,600 --> 00:05:55,900
I now recall that moments
after the time vehicle disappeared...

26
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:57,600
...into the future...

27
00:05:57,600 --> 00:06:01,200
...I saw a vision of Marty
saying he had come back from the future.

28
00:06:01,400 --> 00:06:02,200
Hey, Doc.

29
00:06:02,300 --> 00:06:04,600
Undoubtedly, this was some residual image.

30
00:06:10,100 --> 00:06:13,400
Doc, calm down. It's me. It's Marty.

31
00:06:13,500 --> 00:06:16,100
It can't be you. I sent you back to the future!

32
00:06:16,200 --> 00:06:19,600
That's right, but I came back again
from the future. Don't you remember?

33
00:06:19,700 --> 00:06:21,300
You fainted. I brought you home.

34
00:06:21,400 --> 00:06:23,600
This can't be happening! You can't be here!

35
00:06:23,700 --> 00:06:27,200
It doesn't make sense!
I refuse to believe you are here!

36
00:06:27,400 --> 00:06:31,600
I am here, and it does make sense.
I came back to 1955 again with you.

37
00:06:31,700 --> 00:06:34,400
The you from 1985
is waiting to get a book from Biff!

38
00:06:34,500 --> 00:06:37,800
Once I got the book,
the you from 1985 were in the DeLorean...

39
00:06:37,900 --> 00:06:41,000
...and it got struck by lightning,
and you got sent back to 1885!

40
00:06:41,200 --> 00:06:42,700
1885?

41
00:06:44,600 --> 00:06:47,400
It's a very interesting story, future boy...

42
00:06:47,500 --> 00:06:49,900
...but there's one thing that doesn't make sense.

43
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:54,500
If the me of the future is now in the past,
how could you possibly know about it?

44
00:06:54,800 --> 00:06:56,300
You sent me a letter.

45
00:06:56,400 --> 00:06:58,400
"Dear Marty, if my calculations are correct...

46
00:06:58,500 --> 00:07:02,600
"...you will receive this letter immediately after
the DeLorean's struck by lightning.

47
00:07:02,700 --> 00:07:05,200
"First, let me assure you I am alive and well.

48
00:07:05,400 --> 00:07:09,000
"I've been living happily
these past eight months in the year 1885.

49
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:10,800
"The lightning bolt that hit the DeLorean...

50
00:07:10,800 --> 00:07:13,700
"...caused an overload
which scrambled the time circuits...

51
00:07:13,800 --> 00:07:17,700
"...activated the flux capacitor
and sent me back to 1885.

52
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:20,200
"The overload shorted out the time circuits...

53
00:07:20,300 --> 00:07:24,400
"...and destroyed the flying circuits.
Unfortunately, the car will never fly again."

54
00:07:24,600 --> 00:07:25,800
It actually flew?

55
00:07:25,900 --> 00:07:28,900
Yeah. We had a hover conversion done
in the early 21st century.

56
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:30,400
Incredible!

57
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:33,900
"I set myself up as a blacksmith
as a front...

58
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:37,000
"...while I attempted to repair the damage
to the time circuits.

59
00:07:37,100 --> 00:07:39,000
"Unfortunately, this proved impossible...

60
00:07:39,100 --> 00:07:43,600
"...because suitable replacement parts
will not be invented until 1947.

61
00:07:43,800 --> 00:07:48,400
"However, I've gotten quite adept
at shoeing horses and fixing wagons."

62
00:07:49,500 --> 00:07:52,600
1885! Amazing!

63
00:07:52,700 --> 00:07:56,000
I actually end up as a blacksmith
in the Old West.

64
00:07:56,200 --> 00:07:57,400
Pretty heavy.

65
00:07:57,500 --> 00:08:00,400
"I have buried the DeLorean
in the abandoned Delgado Mine...

66
00:08:00,500 --> 00:08:04,600
"...adjacent to the old Boot Hill Cemetery
as shown on the enclosed map.

67
00:08:04,800 --> 00:08:09,700
"Hopefully, it should remain undisturbed
and preserved until you uncover it in 1955.

68
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:14,300
"Inside, you will find repair instructions.

69
00:08:14,700 --> 00:08:17,600
"My 1955 counterpart..." That's me.

70
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:22,100
"Should have no problem repairing it
so that you can drive it back to the future.

71
00:08:22,200 --> 00:08:25,900
"Once you have returned to 1985,
destroy the time machine."

72
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:29,900
-Destroy it?
-It's a long story, Doc.

73
00:08:30,600 --> 00:08:35,200
"I repeat, do not attempt
to come back here to get me.

74
00:08:35,700 --> 00:08:38,100
"I am perfectly happy living in the fresh air...

75
00:08:38,200 --> 00:08:39,800
"...and wide-open spaces.

76
00:08:39,900 --> 00:08:42,400
"I fear that unnecessary time travel...

77
00:08:42,500 --> 00:08:46,000
"...only risks further disruption
of the space-time continuum.

78
00:08:46,200 --> 00:08:49,400
"And please take care of Einstein for me."

79
00:08:50,900 --> 00:08:51,900
Einstein?

80
00:08:52,100 --> 00:08:56,600
He's your dog, Doc.
Einstein is what you call your dog in 1985.

81
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:01,000
"I know you will give him a good home.

82
00:09:01,100 --> 00:09:05,000
"Remember to walk him twice a day
and that he only likes canned dog food.

83
00:09:05,100 --> 00:09:08,100
"These are my wishes.
Please respect and follow them.

84
00:09:08,200 --> 00:09:12,300
"And so, Marty, I now say farewell
and wish you Godspeed.

85
00:09:12,400 --> 00:09:14,900
"You've been a good,
kind, and loyal friend to me...

86
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:17,600
"...and you made a real difference
in my life.

87
00:09:17,700 --> 00:09:22,000
"I will always treasure our relationship
and think of you with fond memories...

88
00:09:22,100 --> 00:09:24,700
"...warm feelings and a special place
in my heart.

89
00:09:26,700 --> 00:09:30,200
"Your friend in time, Doc Emmett L. Brown.

90
00:09:30,400 --> 00:09:33,200
"September 1, 1885."

91
00:09:34,600 --> 00:09:36,900
I never knew I could write
anything so touching.

92
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:38,400
I know, it's beautiful.

93
00:09:41,400 --> 00:09:44,400
It's all right, Copernicus. Everything will be fine.

94
00:09:44,600 --> 00:09:47,300
I'm sorry.
It's all my fault you're stuck back there.

95
00:09:47,400 --> 00:09:49,000
I never should've let Biff get to me.

96
00:09:49,100 --> 00:09:51,700
There are plenty worse places to be
than the Old West.

97
00:09:51,800 --> 00:09:53,700
I could have ended up in the Dark Ages.

98
00:09:53,800 --> 00:09:56,800
They probably would have burned me
at the stake as a heretic.

99
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:58,500
Let's look at the map.

100
00:09:58,600 --> 00:10:02,400
According to this, the time vehicle
is sealed off in a side tunnel.

101
00:10:03,300 --> 00:10:05,300
We may have to blast.

102
00:10:17,200 --> 00:10:18,500
Whoa!

103
00:10:19,100 --> 00:10:21,400
I think you woke up the dead with that blast.

104
00:10:21,500 --> 00:10:24,100
Take this camera. I want to document everything!

105
00:10:26,400 --> 00:10:30,000
This reminds me of the time I attempted
to reach the center of the Earth.

106
00:10:30,200 --> 00:10:32,700
I'd been reading my favorite author,
Jules Verne.

107
00:10:32,800 --> 00:10:36,200
I spent weeks preparing that expedition.
I didn't even get this far.

108
00:10:36,300 --> 00:10:38,300
Of course, I was only 12 at the time.

109
00:10:38,700 --> 00:10:41,800
You know, it was the writings of Jules Verne...

110
00:10:41,900 --> 00:10:44,400
...that had a profound effect on my life.

111
00:10:44,500 --> 00:10:48,000
When I was 11, I first read
20,000 Leagues Under the Sea.

112
00:10:48,100 --> 00:10:52,200
It was then that I realized
I must devote my life to science.

113
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:55,200
Check it out. Look at this.

114
00:10:58,800 --> 00:11:00,200
My initials!

115
00:11:00,400 --> 00:11:02,600
Just like in
Journey to the Center of the Earth!

116
00:11:02,800 --> 00:11:05,800
That means the time machine
must be right through this wall!

117
00:11:27,100 --> 00:11:31,000
It's been buried in here for 70 years,
two months and 13 days.

118
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:32,400
Astounding!

119
00:11:32,600 --> 00:11:37,500
"As you see, the lightning bolt
shorted out the time-circuit control chip.

120
00:11:39,600 --> 00:11:41,300
"The attached..."

121
00:11:41,700 --> 00:11:42,600
Schematic.

122
00:11:42,700 --> 00:11:46,600
"Schematic diagram will allow you
to build a replacement unit...

123
00:11:46,700 --> 00:11:50,900
"...with 1955 components, thus restoring
the time machine to perfect working order."

124
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:55,000
Unbelievable that this little piece of junk
could be such a big problem.

125
00:11:57,800 --> 00:12:01,200
No wonder this circuit failed.
It says, "Made in Japan."

126
00:12:02,300 --> 00:12:05,500
What do you mean, Doc?
All the best stuff is made in Japan.

127
00:12:07,600 --> 00:12:08,700
Unbelievable!

128
00:12:14,800 --> 00:12:19,100
You know, when I was a kid,
I always wanted to be a cowboy.

129
00:12:20,200 --> 00:12:22,700
Now, knowing I'm spending my future
in the past...

130
00:12:22,800 --> 00:12:25,800
...it sounds like a wonderful way
to spend my retirement years.

131
00:12:26,200 --> 00:12:29,100
It just occurred to me, since I end up in 1885...

132
00:12:29,200 --> 00:12:32,400
...perhaps I'm now in the history books.
I wonder.

133
00:12:33,200 --> 00:12:36,600
Could I look myself up
in the old newspaper archives?

134
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:38,000
I don't know.

135
00:12:38,200 --> 00:12:41,500
You always say it's not good
to know too much about your own destiny.

136
00:12:41,600 --> 00:12:44,600
You're right, Marty. I know too much already.

137
00:12:44,900 --> 00:12:49,000
Better that I not attempt to uncover
the circumstances of my own future.

138
00:12:50,200 --> 00:12:53,200
Copernicus. Come on, boy!

139
00:12:53,400 --> 00:12:54,500
I'll get him.

140
00:12:54,600 --> 00:12:55,800
Copernicus!

141
00:12:56,800 --> 00:12:59,000
Come on. Let's go home, boy.

142
00:13:00,500 --> 00:13:01,500
What's wrong?

143
00:13:02,500 --> 00:13:04,000
What's wrong, Copernicus?

144
00:13:06,700 --> 00:13:08,100
Come on, let's go.

145
00:13:11,800 --> 00:13:14,700
Doc, come here!

146
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:16,200
Quick!

147
00:13:17,800 --> 00:13:20,900
What's wrong?
You look like you've seen a ghost.

148
00:13:21,300 --> 00:13:23,000
You're not far off, Doc.

149
00:13:27,200 --> 00:13:28,600
Great Scott!

150
00:13:29,500 --> 00:13:30,700
Check this out.

151
00:13:30,800 --> 00:13:35,400
"Died September 7, 1885."
That's one week after you wrote the letter!

152
00:13:35,600 --> 00:13:38,700
"Erected in eternal memory
by his beloved Clara."

153
00:13:39,100 --> 00:13:40,200
Who the hell is Clara?

154
00:13:40,300 --> 00:13:44,000
-Please don't stand there!
-Right. Sorry.

155
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:45,800
I have to get another picture.

156
00:13:47,200 --> 00:13:51,500
"Shot in the back by Buford Tannen
over a matter of $80"?

157
00:13:51,600 --> 00:13:53,800
What kind of a future do you call that?

158
00:13:54,800 --> 00:13:57,200
"Buford Tannen was a notorious gunman...

159
00:13:57,400 --> 00:14:00,000
"...whose short temper and a tendency to drool...

160
00:14:00,100 --> 00:14:01,900
"...earned him the nickname 'Mad Dog.'

161
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:05,100
"He was quick on the trigger
and bragged he had killed 12 men...

162
00:14:05,200 --> 00:14:07,200
"...not including Indians or Chinamen."

163
00:14:07,300 --> 00:14:09,900
Does it name me? Am I one of the 12?
Wait.

164
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:13,400
"This claim cannot be proven
since precise records were not kept...

165
00:14:13,500 --> 00:14:15,300
"...after Tannen shot a newspaper editor...

166
00:14:15,400 --> 00:14:17,800
"...who printed an unfavorable story
about him in 1884."

167
00:14:17,900 --> 00:14:20,200
That's why we can't find anything.
Look.

168
00:14:21,500 --> 00:14:24,300
William McFly and family.
Your relatives?

169
00:14:24,400 --> 00:14:29,400
My great-grandfather's name
was William. That's him. Good-Iooking guy.

170
00:14:31,200 --> 00:14:33,100
McFlys, but no Browns.

171
00:14:33,200 --> 00:14:35,700
Maybe it was a mistake.
Maybe that grave wasn't yours.

172
00:14:35,800 --> 00:14:38,000
There could've been
another Emmett Brown in 1885.

173
00:14:38,100 --> 00:14:40,000
Did you have any relatives here back then?

174
00:14:40,200 --> 00:14:44,100
The Browns didn't come to Hill Valley
until 1908. Then they were the von Brauns.

175
00:14:44,200 --> 00:14:46,500
My father changed our name
during World War I.

176
00:14:46,600 --> 00:14:47,500
Look.

177
00:14:49,600 --> 00:14:51,800
Great Scott, it's me!

178
00:14:52,700 --> 00:14:54,800
Then it is true, all of it.

179
00:14:55,500 --> 00:14:58,400
It is me who goes back there and gets shot.

180
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:00,600
It's not gonna happen, Doc.

181
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:04,400
After you fix the time circuits
and put new tires on the DeLorean...

182
00:15:04,500 --> 00:15:07,800
...I'm going back to 1885,
and I'm bringing you home.

183
00:15:18,800 --> 00:15:20,400
The clothes fit?

184
00:15:20,700 --> 00:15:24,000
Everything except the boots.
They're kind of tight.

185
00:15:24,100 --> 00:15:26,300
Are you sure this stuff is authentic?

186
00:15:26,400 --> 00:15:29,200
Of course.
Haven't you ever seen a Western?

187
00:15:30,400 --> 00:15:32,100
Yeah, I have.

188
00:15:32,600 --> 00:15:35,200
Clint Eastwood never wore anything like this.

189
00:15:36,500 --> 00:15:40,000
-Clint who?
-Right. You haven't heard of him yet.

190
00:15:40,100 --> 00:15:41,700
You have to wear the boots.

191
00:15:41,800 --> 00:15:44,600
You can't wear those futuristic things
back in 1885.

192
00:15:44,600 --> 00:15:46,800
You shouldn't be wearing them
here in 1955.

193
00:15:46,800 --> 00:15:49,200
-As soon as I get there, I'll put them on.
-Okay.

194
00:15:49,300 --> 00:15:51,800
I think we're about ready.
I put gas in the tank.

195
00:15:51,800 --> 00:15:53,500
Your future clothes are packed.

196
00:15:53,600 --> 00:15:57,300
Just in case,
fresh batteries for your walkie-talkies.

197
00:15:57,400 --> 00:15:59,700
What about that floating device?

198
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:01,900
Hoverboard.
All right.

199
00:16:03,700 --> 00:16:06,400
It's gonna be a long walk
back to Hill Valley from here.

200
00:16:06,700 --> 00:16:08,300
It's still the safest plan.

201
00:16:08,400 --> 00:16:11,200
We can't risk sending you back
into a populated area...

202
00:16:11,200 --> 00:16:13,400
...or to a spot that's geographically unknown.

203
00:16:13,500 --> 00:16:16,700
You don't want to crash into some tree
that existed in the past.

204
00:16:16,800 --> 00:16:19,000
This was all completely open country...

205
00:16:19,100 --> 00:16:21,800
...so you'll have plenty of runout space
when you arrive.

206
00:16:21,900 --> 00:16:24,600
Remember, where you're going,
there are no roads.

207
00:16:24,700 --> 00:16:28,800
There's a small cave over there which will be
a good place to hide the time vehicle.

208
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:32,200
The new time-circuit control tubes
are warmed up.

209
00:16:35,200 --> 00:16:36,300
Time circuits on.

210
00:16:36,400 --> 00:16:39,300
I wrote the letter on September 1,
so we'll send you to...

211
00:16:39,400 --> 00:16:42,800
...September 2, that's a Wednesday.
September 2, 1885, 8:00 a.m.

212
00:16:42,900 --> 00:16:45,800
I get shot on Monday the 7th.
You have five days to locate me.

213
00:16:45,900 --> 00:16:49,600
According to my letter, I'm a blacksmith,
so I probably have a shop somewhere.

214
00:16:49,700 --> 00:16:51,800
All you got to do is drive the time vehicle...

215
00:16:51,900 --> 00:16:55,100
...directly toward that screen,
accelerating to 88 miles an hour.

216
00:16:55,200 --> 00:16:56,300
Wait a minute.

217
00:16:56,400 --> 00:16:59,600
If I drive straight towards the screen,
I'll crash into those Indians.

218
00:16:59,800 --> 00:17:02,600
Marty, you're not thinking fourth dimensionally.

219
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:07,600
You'll instantly be transported to 1885
and those Indians won't even be there.

220
00:17:08,300 --> 00:17:09,300
Right.

221
00:17:11,800 --> 00:17:14,100
Good luck, for both of our sakes.

222
00:17:14,600 --> 00:17:16,400
See you in the future.

223
00:17:16,800 --> 00:17:19,000
-You mean the past.
-Exactly.

224
00:17:25,300 --> 00:17:27,200
Happy trails, Marty!

225
00:17:32,500 --> 00:17:33,700
Ready, Marty?

226
00:17:34,900 --> 00:17:36,200
Ready!

227
00:17:36,600 --> 00:17:39,100
-Set!
-Hi-ho, Silver.

228
00:18:14,800 --> 00:18:16,000
Indians!

229
00:18:54,300 --> 00:18:55,700
The cave!

230
00:19:28,800 --> 00:19:31,300
Charge!

231
00:19:34,200 --> 00:19:35,900
Shit! The cavalry!

232
00:20:24,200 --> 00:20:25,700
Damn, I ripped the fuel line.

233
00:21:09,200 --> 00:21:12,600
Maggie! Fetch some water!
We got a hurt man here.

234
00:21:20,900 --> 00:21:21,900
Mom.

235
00:21:22,300 --> 00:21:24,600
Mom, is that you?
There, there.

236
00:21:24,800 --> 00:21:27,500
You've been asleep for nearly six hours.

237
00:21:27,900 --> 00:21:30,100
I had this horrible nightmare.

238
00:21:31,700 --> 00:21:34,900
I dreamed I was in a Western.

239
00:21:36,500 --> 00:21:39,700
I was being chased by all these Indians...

240
00:21:41,100 --> 00:21:42,600
...and a bear.

241
00:21:42,900 --> 00:21:45,800
You're safe and sound now
here at the McFly farm.

242
00:21:46,900 --> 00:21:48,300
"McFly farm"?

243
00:21:51,500 --> 00:21:52,800
You're my...

244
00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:54,000
You're my...

245
00:21:56,800 --> 00:22:00,000
-Who are you?
-The name is Maggie McFly.

246
00:22:00,500 --> 00:22:01,400
McFly?

247
00:22:02,800 --> 00:22:03,900
Maggie?

248
00:22:04,100 --> 00:22:07,100
And that's Mrs. McFly,
and don't you be forgetting the "Mrs."

249
00:22:07,200 --> 00:22:09,800
What might your name be, sir?
It's...

250
00:22:13,700 --> 00:22:15,000
Eastwood.

251
00:22:16,600 --> 00:22:18,600
Clint Eastwood.

252
00:22:19,200 --> 00:22:20,900
You hit your head, Mr. Eastwood.

253
00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:24,500
Not too serious, but lucky for you
Seamus found you when he did.

254
00:22:24,600 --> 00:22:25,600
Seamus.

255
00:22:26,500 --> 00:22:27,800
Me husband.

256
00:22:29,300 --> 00:22:32,400
You'll be excusing me, while I tend to William.

257
00:22:33,600 --> 00:22:34,600
William.

258
00:22:34,700 --> 00:22:36,100
That's okay, Will.

259
00:22:43,900 --> 00:22:45,700
That's William?
Aye.

260
00:22:46,100 --> 00:22:49,800
William Sean McFly,
the first of our family to be born in America.

261
00:22:50,500 --> 00:22:54,400
It's okay, Will.
This here is Mr. Clint Eastwood visiting.

262
00:22:55,400 --> 00:22:57,300
He sure likes you.

263
00:22:58,200 --> 00:22:59,200
Maggie.

264
00:23:01,700 --> 00:23:02,700
I've got supper.

265
00:23:02,800 --> 00:23:05,400
I'm not one to pry
into a man's personal affairs...

266
00:23:05,500 --> 00:23:09,700
...but exactly how is it
you came to be way out here...

267
00:23:09,900 --> 00:23:13,400
...without a horse, or boots, or a hat?

268
00:23:14,100 --> 00:23:16,100
Well, my...

269
00:23:16,200 --> 00:23:19,400
...horse broke down and a bear ate my boots...

270
00:23:19,600 --> 00:23:21,200
...and I just forgot my hat.

271
00:23:21,200 --> 00:23:23,900
How could you forget a thing like your hat?

272
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:26,400
-Would you like some water?
-Yeah.

273
00:23:36,600 --> 00:23:38,900
I'll tell you what I'll do, Mr. Eastwood.

274
00:23:39,100 --> 00:23:41,700
I'll help you find your blacksmith friend.

275
00:23:42,600 --> 00:23:44,500
You can stay the night in the barn...

276
00:23:45,600 --> 00:23:48,600
...and tomorrow I'll take you
as far as the railroad tracks.

277
00:23:48,700 --> 00:23:51,400
You can follow them straight into town.

278
00:23:54,200 --> 00:23:56,200
I'll even give you a hat.

279
00:23:58,700 --> 00:24:00,500
That's great. Thanks.

280
00:24:04,700 --> 00:24:06,400
That's my William.

281
00:24:07,200 --> 00:24:08,500
Wee Willy.

282
00:24:12,400 --> 00:24:13,500
Yes.

283
00:24:14,600 --> 00:24:17,000
I think you'll find the barn comfortable.

284
00:24:17,100 --> 00:24:19,700
Never had any complaints about it
from the pigs.

285
00:24:19,800 --> 00:24:21,000
Seamus.

286
00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:24,400
A word with you.
Aye.

287
00:24:27,600 --> 00:24:29,500
Will you hold him for a minute?

288
00:24:33,500 --> 00:24:37,500
Are you sure you're not bringing a curse
on this house taking him in like that?

289
00:24:38,200 --> 00:24:41,900
-He's such a strange young man.
-Aye, but I've just got a feeling about him.

290
00:24:42,600 --> 00:24:46,000
Looking after him is the right thing to do.
That's important.

291
00:24:46,400 --> 00:24:47,500
Hey, buddy.

292
00:24:47,900 --> 00:24:49,700
Look how the baby takes to him.

293
00:24:50,200 --> 00:24:52,800
Little Will never takes to strangers.

294
00:24:53,800 --> 00:24:56,800
It's almost as if he's connected to us.

295
00:24:56,900 --> 00:24:57,800
Hey, Will.

296
00:24:58,300 --> 00:25:00,400
So you're my great-grandfather.

297
00:25:01,000 --> 00:25:03,300
The first McFly born in America.

298
00:25:08,700 --> 00:25:10,300
And you peed on me.

299
00:25:59,100 --> 00:26:01,500
Give us some soap.
Here you go.

300
00:27:44,300 --> 00:27:47,600
Take a look and see
what just breezed in the door.

301
00:27:49,400 --> 00:27:52,000
I didn't know the circus was in town.

302
00:27:52,200 --> 00:27:55,500
Must have got that shirt off a dead Chinese.

303
00:28:14,800 --> 00:28:16,800
What will it be, stranger?

304
00:28:18,900 --> 00:28:19,800
I'll have...

305
00:28:21,200 --> 00:28:23,100
..ice water.
Ice water?

306
00:28:25,000 --> 00:28:26,000
Water?

307
00:28:26,300 --> 00:28:30,300
You want water, you better dunk your head
in the horse trough out there.

308
00:28:30,600 --> 00:28:33,600
In here, we pour whiskey.

309
00:28:44,000 --> 00:28:45,800
-Excuse me.
-For what?

310
00:28:46,600 --> 00:28:48,200
I'm trying to find a blacksmith.

311
00:28:49,800 --> 00:28:51,200
Hey, McFly!

312
00:28:53,100 --> 00:28:55,700
Thought I told you never to come in...

313
00:28:57,500 --> 00:28:59,400
You ain't Seamus McFly.

314
00:29:00,800 --> 00:29:04,300
You look like him, though,
especially with that dog-ugly hat.

315
00:29:07,100 --> 00:29:09,200
You kin to that hay barber?

316
00:29:09,600 --> 00:29:12,600
-What's your name, dude?
-Marty...

317
00:29:13,600 --> 00:29:14,600
Eastwood.

318
00:29:16,300 --> 00:29:17,800
Clint Eastwood.

319
00:29:19,500 --> 00:29:23,800
-What kind of stupid name is that?
-He's the runt of the litter.

320
00:29:23,900 --> 00:29:26,500
Boys, would you look-see
at these pearly whites?

321
00:29:26,600 --> 00:29:29,400
I ain't seen teeth that straight
that weren't store-bought.

322
00:29:29,500 --> 00:29:32,500
Take a gander at them moccasins.
What kind of skins is them?

323
00:29:32,600 --> 00:29:36,200
What's that writing mean?
"Nike"? Is that Indian talk?

324
00:29:39,600 --> 00:29:43,100
Bartender, I'm looking for that no-good,
cheating blacksmith.

325
00:29:43,200 --> 00:29:46,400
-You seen him?
-No, sir, Mr. Tannen. I have not.

326
00:29:47,400 --> 00:29:48,700
Tannen.

327
00:29:49,900 --> 00:29:51,700
You're Mad Dog Tannen.

328
00:29:57,200 --> 00:29:58,600
"Mad Dog"?

329
00:29:59,000 --> 00:30:00,600
I hate that name.

330
00:30:01,200 --> 00:30:03,000
I hate it, you hear?

331
00:30:03,800 --> 00:30:05,800
Nobody calls me "Mad Dog"!

332
00:30:06,700 --> 00:30:10,900
Especially not some duded-up,
egg-sucking gutter trash.

333
00:30:11,800 --> 00:30:14,800
Dance! Come on!

334
00:30:17,100 --> 00:30:20,500
Come on, runt!
You can dance better than that!

335
00:30:30,300 --> 00:30:31,400
Shit.

336
00:30:52,100 --> 00:30:54,600
-You better run, squirrel.
-Get him!

337
00:31:56,100 --> 00:32:00,600
We got ourselves a new courthouse.
It's high time we had a hanging!

338
00:32:19,600 --> 00:32:21,200
Look at him sway.

339
00:32:25,000 --> 00:32:27,500
Yeah, haven't had a hanging in a long time!

340
00:32:30,800 --> 00:32:34,400
I shoot the fleas off a dog's back
at 500 yards, Tannen...

341
00:32:34,500 --> 00:32:36,900
...and it's pointed at your head!

342
00:32:46,200 --> 00:32:49,000
You owe me money, blacksmith.
How do you figure?

343
00:32:49,200 --> 00:32:50,700
My horse threw a shoe.

344
00:32:50,800 --> 00:32:53,300
You done the shoeing,
so that makes you responsible.

345
00:32:53,800 --> 00:32:57,500
Since you never paid me for the job,
I'd say that makes us even.

346
00:32:57,700 --> 00:32:58,500
Wrong!

347
00:32:58,600 --> 00:33:01,500
I was on my horse when it happened,
and I got throwed off!

348
00:33:01,600 --> 00:33:05,900
That caused me to bust a perfectly
good bottle of fine Kentucky redeye.

349
00:33:06,000 --> 00:33:09,700
The way I figure it, blacksmith,
you owe me $5 for the whiskey...

350
00:33:09,800 --> 00:33:11,700
...and $75 for the horse!

351
00:33:12,700 --> 00:33:14,200
That's the $80.

352
00:33:14,400 --> 00:33:18,200
If your horse threw a shoe,
bring him back and I'll reshoe him.

353
00:33:18,300 --> 00:33:19,800
I shot that horse!

354
00:33:19,900 --> 00:33:24,100
-That's your problem, Tannen.
-Wrong. That's yours.

355
00:33:25,000 --> 00:33:28,700
From now on,
you better be looking behind you when you walk.

356
00:33:28,800 --> 00:33:31,500
Because one day you're gonna get
a bullet in your back.

357
00:33:40,600 --> 00:33:41,500
Doc!

358
00:33:41,600 --> 00:33:46,400
Marty, I gave you explicit instructions
not to come here...

359
00:33:46,500 --> 00:33:48,800
...but to go directly back to 1985.

360
00:33:48,900 --> 00:33:50,900
I know, but I had to come.

361
00:33:52,200 --> 00:33:54,000
It's good to see you, Marty.

362
00:33:58,400 --> 00:34:00,600
You've got to do something
about those clothes.

363
00:34:00,600 --> 00:34:04,400
-Dressed like that, you're liable to get shot.
-Or hanged.

364
00:34:04,500 --> 00:34:06,800
What idiot dressed you in that outfit?

365
00:34:07,600 --> 00:34:08,800
You did.

366
00:34:11,400 --> 00:34:15,800
"Shot in the back by Buford Tannen
over a matter of $80"?

367
00:34:16,100 --> 00:34:17,600
"September 7"?

368
00:34:18,200 --> 00:34:19,900
That's this Monday!

369
00:34:20,300 --> 00:34:22,200
Now I wish I'd paid him off.

370
00:34:22,700 --> 00:34:26,300
Who's this "beloved Clara"?
I don't know anyone named Clara.

371
00:34:26,800 --> 00:34:28,200
I don't know, Doc.

372
00:34:29,300 --> 00:34:31,600
I thought maybe she was a girlfriend of yours.

373
00:34:31,700 --> 00:34:34,700
My involvement in such a social relationship...

374
00:34:34,800 --> 00:34:36,400
...here in 1885...

375
00:34:36,800 --> 00:34:40,300
...could result in a disruption
of the space-time continuum.

376
00:34:40,600 --> 00:34:42,300
As a scientist...

377
00:34:42,900 --> 00:34:44,900
...I can never take that risk.

378
00:34:46,000 --> 00:34:48,500
Certainly not after
what we've already been through.

379
00:34:48,600 --> 00:34:51,800
Emmett! Hello, Emmett.
Hubert.

380
00:34:52,600 --> 00:34:53,500
It's the mayor.

381
00:34:53,600 --> 00:34:54,900
Excuse me, Emmett.

382
00:34:56,000 --> 00:34:58,600
Do you remember last week
when you volunteered...

383
00:34:58,600 --> 00:35:01,200
...to meet the new schoolteacher
at the station?

384
00:35:01,300 --> 00:35:02,200
Yes, quite so.

385
00:35:02,300 --> 00:35:04,300
We just got word she's coming in tomorrow.

386
00:35:04,600 --> 00:35:06,300
Here are the details for you.

387
00:35:06,500 --> 00:35:09,300
Thanks for all your help.
Anytime, Hubert.

388
00:35:09,400 --> 00:35:10,800
Oh!

389
00:35:10,900 --> 00:35:13,800
Her name's Miss Clara Clayton.

390
00:35:22,000 --> 00:35:23,400
Well, Doc...

391
00:35:24,500 --> 00:35:26,500
...now we know who Clara is.

392
00:35:27,600 --> 00:35:29,700
Marty, it's impossible.

393
00:35:29,800 --> 00:35:33,900
The idea that I could fall in love
at first sight is romantic nonsense.

394
00:35:34,000 --> 00:35:36,700
There's no scientific rationale
for that concept.

395
00:35:36,800 --> 00:35:38,000
It's not science.

396
00:35:38,100 --> 00:35:40,800
You meet the right girl, it hits you like lightning.

397
00:35:40,900 --> 00:35:42,400
Please, don't say that.

398
00:35:42,500 --> 00:35:44,800
That's the way it was for me and Jennifer.

399
00:35:44,900 --> 00:35:47,200
We couldn't keep our eyes off each other.

400
00:35:47,800 --> 00:35:49,800
God, Jennifer, I hope she's all right.

401
00:35:49,900 --> 00:35:52,200
I can't believe we just left her on the porch.

402
00:35:52,200 --> 00:35:54,100
Don't worry. She'll be fine.

403
00:35:54,200 --> 00:35:57,900
When you burned the almanac in 1955,
the normal timeline was restored.

404
00:35:58,000 --> 00:35:59,700
Once we're back in 1985...

405
00:35:59,800 --> 00:36:02,500
...you just have to go to her house
to wake her up.

406
00:36:03,700 --> 00:36:06,900
Turn that valve over there,
all the way to the right.

407
00:36:07,000 --> 00:36:08,800
Yeah, pull it all the way around.

408
00:36:09,100 --> 00:36:10,100
Let's go!

409
00:36:23,700 --> 00:36:25,800
Ice tea?
No, thanks.

410
00:36:27,200 --> 00:36:28,900
It's a refrigerator.

411
00:36:29,000 --> 00:36:32,400
I guess Miss Clayton
will have to find other transportation.

412
00:36:32,500 --> 00:36:36,000
If I never meet her, there's no possibility
of a romantic infatuation.

413
00:36:36,100 --> 00:36:37,400
-You're the doc.
-All right.

414
00:36:37,500 --> 00:36:40,200
We'll get the DeLorean and get back to the future.

415
00:36:40,300 --> 00:36:42,900
I tore a hole in the gas tank
when I was landing...

416
00:36:43,000 --> 00:36:45,300
...so we'll have to patch it up
and get some gas.

417
00:36:45,400 --> 00:36:47,100
You mean, we're out of gas?

418
00:36:47,500 --> 00:36:50,300
Yeah. It's no big deal.
We've got Mr. Fusion, right?

419
00:36:50,400 --> 00:36:54,000
Mr. Fusion powers the time circuits
and the flux capacitor.

420
00:36:54,100 --> 00:36:57,000
But the internal combustion engine
runs on ordinary gasoline.

421
00:36:57,100 --> 00:36:58,600
It always has.

422
00:36:58,800 --> 00:37:02,800
There won't be a gas station around here
until sometime in the next century.

423
00:37:03,400 --> 00:37:08,100
Without gasoline,
we can't get the DeLorean up to 88 mph.

424
00:37:10,500 --> 00:37:11,800
So what do we do?

425
00:37:21,900 --> 00:37:25,000
-Twenty-four!
-It's no use, Marty!

426
00:37:25,100 --> 00:37:29,400
Even the fastest horse in the world
won't run more than 35, 40 miles an hour!

427
00:37:40,000 --> 00:37:42,600
Bartender said that's the strongest stuff they got.

428
00:37:43,000 --> 00:37:44,200
Try it, Marty.

429
00:37:55,600 --> 00:37:57,300
Give it more gas!

430
00:38:06,300 --> 00:38:07,400
Damn!

431
00:38:09,000 --> 00:38:13,100
It blew the fuel injection manifold.
Strong stuff, all right.

432
00:38:13,600 --> 00:38:15,800
It will take me a month to rebuild it.

433
00:38:16,500 --> 00:38:17,800
A month?

434
00:38:18,200 --> 00:38:21,700
-You're gonna get shot on Monday!
-I know!

435
00:38:21,800 --> 00:38:23,400
I wish...

436
00:38:23,500 --> 00:38:24,400
Wait.

437
00:38:24,700 --> 00:38:27,600
I've got it! We can roll it down a steep hill!

438
00:38:27,800 --> 00:38:30,600
We'll never find a smooth enough surface.
Unless...

439
00:38:30,700 --> 00:38:32,400
Of course! Ice!

440
00:38:32,700 --> 00:38:35,300
We'll wait until winter
when the lake freezes over.

441
00:38:35,400 --> 00:38:38,400
Winter? What are you saying?
Monday is three days away!

442
00:38:38,500 --> 00:38:42,200
All right. Let's just think
this thing through logically.

443
00:38:42,400 --> 00:38:45,700
We know it won't run under its own power.
We know we can't pull it.

444
00:38:46,200 --> 00:38:49,400
But if we could figure out a way...

445
00:38:49,500 --> 00:38:52,800
...to push it up to 88 miles an hour...

446
00:39:01,700 --> 00:39:03,100
That's it.

447
00:39:03,200 --> 00:39:06,700
How fast can she go?
Why, I've had her up to 55 myself.

448
00:39:07,800 --> 00:39:11,200
I heard that Fearless Frank Fargo
got one of these up to near 70...

449
00:39:11,300 --> 00:39:12,600
...out past Verde Junction.

450
00:39:13,100 --> 00:39:15,600
Do you think it's possible to get it up to 90?

451
00:39:15,700 --> 00:39:19,300
Ninety? Tarnation.
Who would ever need to be in such a hurry?

452
00:39:19,400 --> 00:39:21,700
Just a little bet he and I have, that's all.

453
00:39:22,000 --> 00:39:24,100
Theoretically speaking, could it be done?

454
00:39:24,500 --> 00:39:28,000
I suppose, if you had a straight
stretch of track with a level grade...

455
00:39:28,200 --> 00:39:30,200
...and you weren't hauling no cars...

456
00:39:30,400 --> 00:39:32,300
...and if you could get the fire hot enough.

457
00:39:32,500 --> 00:39:35,700
I'm talking about hotter than the blazes
of Hell itself.

458
00:39:36,100 --> 00:39:38,400
It might be possible to get her up that fast.

459
00:39:38,600 --> 00:39:40,400
When does the next train come through?

460
00:39:40,600 --> 00:39:42,000
Monday morning at 8:00.

461
00:39:42,100 --> 00:39:45,700
Here. This spur that runs
off the main line 3 miles out to Clayton Ravine.

462
00:39:46,100 --> 00:39:49,600
It's a long stretch of level track
that will still exist in 1985.

463
00:39:49,900 --> 00:39:52,700
This is where we'll push the DeLorean
with the locomotive.

464
00:39:53,300 --> 00:39:56,700
Funny. This map calls Clayton Ravine
"Shonash Ravine."

465
00:39:56,800 --> 00:39:59,600
That must be the old Indian name for it.
It's perfect.

466
00:39:59,800 --> 00:40:02,600
A long run that goes
across the bridge over the ravine...

467
00:40:02,800 --> 00:40:05,000
...over near that Hilldale housing development.

468
00:40:05,200 --> 00:40:07,500
Right, but according to this map...

469
00:40:08,300 --> 00:40:09,500
...there is no bridge.

470
00:40:09,900 --> 00:40:12,900
Well, Doc, we can scratch that idea.

471
00:40:13,300 --> 00:40:15,800
We can't wait for this thing to get finished.

472
00:40:15,800 --> 00:40:17,000
Marty, it's perfect.

473
00:40:17,300 --> 00:40:19,200
You're not thinking fourth dimensionally.

474
00:40:19,400 --> 00:40:21,000
Right. I have a problem with that.

475
00:40:21,200 --> 00:40:24,600
Don't you see? The bridge will exist in 1985.

476
00:40:24,800 --> 00:40:26,300
It's safe and still in use.

477
00:40:26,400 --> 00:40:29,200
As long as we get the DeLorean
up to 88 miles an hour...

478
00:40:29,200 --> 00:40:31,200
...before we hit the edge of the ravine...

479
00:40:31,300 --> 00:40:35,400
...we'll instantaneously arrive at a point
in time where the bridge is completed.

480
00:40:35,800 --> 00:40:40,100
We'll have track under us
and coast safely across the ravine.

481
00:40:41,200 --> 00:40:44,200
What about the train?
It will be a spectacular wreck.

482
00:40:44,300 --> 00:40:46,500
Too bad no one will be around to see it.

483
00:40:47,700 --> 00:40:50,800
Help me!
Great Scott!

484
00:41:32,000 --> 00:41:33,100
Hurry!

485
00:41:35,000 --> 00:41:36,000
Jump!

486
00:41:50,400 --> 00:41:53,000
Thank you, sir. You saved my...

487
00:41:55,300 --> 00:41:56,500
...life.

488
00:42:00,400 --> 00:42:02,500
Emmett Brown at your service, Miss...

489
00:42:06,000 --> 00:42:07,400
Clayton.

490
00:42:08,800 --> 00:42:10,300
Clara Clayton.

491
00:42:11,300 --> 00:42:12,300
Clara?

492
00:42:15,800 --> 00:42:17,500
What a beautiful name.

493
00:42:34,100 --> 00:42:36,200
May I help you inside with these?

494
00:42:36,800 --> 00:42:39,600
That won't be necessary. I can take care of it.

495
00:42:39,600 --> 00:42:43,200
-You've done more than enough already.
-But it's really no trouble.

496
00:42:43,600 --> 00:42:46,000
She says it's fine, and we have to get going.

497
00:42:46,200 --> 00:42:49,400
Ma'am, good luck
with your school teaching and everything.

498
00:42:49,900 --> 00:42:51,200
Clara.

499
00:42:51,800 --> 00:42:54,600
I'll straighten everything out
for the buckboard rental.

500
00:42:54,600 --> 00:42:58,600
Don't worry about that.
I feel somewhat responsible for what happened.

501
00:42:59,500 --> 00:43:03,100
That would be very gentlemanly of you,
Mr. Brown. Emmett.

502
00:43:06,200 --> 00:43:10,000
You know, I'm almost glad
that snake spooked those horses.

503
00:43:10,100 --> 00:43:12,500
Otherwise, we might never have met.

504
00:43:13,000 --> 00:43:14,600
I suppose it was destiny.

505
00:43:18,200 --> 00:43:19,900
Thank you for everything.

506
00:43:20,300 --> 00:43:22,100
You're quite welcome.

507
00:43:24,300 --> 00:43:26,600
I will see you again, won't I?

508
00:43:26,800 --> 00:43:29,600
Of course. You'll see lots of me.
I have a shop in town.

509
00:43:29,700 --> 00:43:32,700
I'm the local scientist, I mean, blacksmith.

510
00:43:33,100 --> 00:43:35,600
What sort of science?

511
00:43:35,800 --> 00:43:37,800
Astronomy? Chemistry?

512
00:43:38,000 --> 00:43:40,200
Actually, I'm a student of all sciences.

513
00:43:40,300 --> 00:43:43,000
Doc, we have to get going.

514
00:43:43,200 --> 00:43:45,800
Yes. Excuse us, Clara.

515
00:43:46,400 --> 00:43:48,500
We have to get going.

516
00:43:52,500 --> 00:43:53,900
Toodle-oo.

517
00:44:01,500 --> 00:44:03,900
What do you mean,
you'll be seeing lots of her?

518
00:44:04,000 --> 00:44:06,300
I might see her again just in passing.

519
00:44:07,100 --> 00:44:09,600
Did you see the way she was looking at you?

520
00:44:10,400 --> 00:44:12,600
She did have quite a scare, right?

521
00:44:13,600 --> 00:44:16,800
Miss Clayton almost ended up
at the bottom of Clayton Ravine.

522
00:44:17,600 --> 00:44:22,200
Holy shit.
Clayton Ravine was named after a teacher.

523
00:44:23,000 --> 00:44:26,400
-They say she fell in there 100 years ago.
-100 years ago!

524
00:44:26,700 --> 00:44:29,000
-That's this year!
-Every kid knows that story.

525
00:44:29,100 --> 00:44:31,900
We all have teachers we'd like to see
fall into the ravine.

526
00:44:32,000 --> 00:44:33,400
Great Scott!

527
00:44:34,700 --> 00:44:37,400
Then she was supposed to go over
in that wagon.

528
00:44:38,800 --> 00:44:41,500
Now I may have seriously altered history.

529
00:44:42,800 --> 00:44:45,600
Look, Doc, what's the worse that can happen?

530
00:44:45,700 --> 00:44:47,900
So they don't name the ravine after her.

531
00:44:48,000 --> 00:44:50,400
Let's get the DeLorean ready
and get out of here.

532
00:44:50,500 --> 00:44:53,600
I wish I'd never invented
that infernal time machine.

533
00:44:55,000 --> 00:44:58,100
It's caused nothing but disaster.

534
00:45:01,200 --> 00:45:02,200
Doc, this is Marty.

535
00:45:02,300 --> 00:45:03,400
Do you read me? Over.

536
00:45:03,500 --> 00:45:04,600
Check, Marty.

537
00:45:04,700 --> 00:45:06,400
Great. These things still work.

538
00:45:07,200 --> 00:45:10,700
All right. Once more,
let's go over the entire plan and layout.

539
00:45:11,800 --> 00:45:16,500
-I apologize for the crudity of this model...
-Yeah, it's not to scale. It's okay.

540
00:45:16,700 --> 00:45:19,500
All right. Tomorrow night, Sunday...

541
00:45:20,100 --> 00:45:23,300
...we load the DeLorean
onto the tracks here, on the spur...

542
00:45:23,400 --> 00:45:25,200
...by the abandoned silver mine.

543
00:45:25,200 --> 00:45:28,000
The switch track is where the spur runs
off the main line...

544
00:45:28,100 --> 00:45:31,400
...three miles out to Clayton... Shonash Ravine.

545
00:45:31,700 --> 00:45:34,300
The train leaves the station
at 8:00 Monday morning.

546
00:45:34,400 --> 00:45:38,900
We'll stop it, uncouple the cars,
throw the switch track and then hijack...

547
00:45:39,000 --> 00:45:42,500
...borrow the locomotive and use it
to push the time machine.

548
00:45:42,700 --> 00:45:46,200
According to my calculations we'll reach
88 mph just before we hit...

549
00:45:46,400 --> 00:45:51,200
...the edge of the ravine,
at which point we'll be transported back to 1985...

550
00:45:51,300 --> 00:45:53,900
...and coast safely across the completed bridge.

551
00:45:54,000 --> 00:45:56,200
What does this mean? "Point of no return."

552
00:45:56,300 --> 00:45:58,200
That's our fail-safe point.

553
00:45:58,200 --> 00:46:02,100
Till there, we have time to stop the locomotive
before it plunges into the ravine.

554
00:46:02,200 --> 00:46:05,400
But once we pass this windmill,
it's the future or bust.

555
00:46:07,400 --> 00:46:10,500
Here you go.
Connect that to the positive terminal.

556
00:46:11,900 --> 00:46:14,600
All right, you all set?
Yeah. Go!

557
00:46:14,600 --> 00:46:16,800
Train pulling out of the station!

558
00:46:17,200 --> 00:46:19,100
Coming up to the switch track!

559
00:46:19,300 --> 00:46:20,800
Stop at the switch track!

560
00:46:21,700 --> 00:46:23,400
Throw the switch!

561
00:46:24,000 --> 00:46:26,000
Pull up to the DeLorean!

562
00:46:26,400 --> 00:46:28,100
Pushing the DeLorean...

563
00:46:28,200 --> 00:46:31,600
...up to 88 miles per hour!

564
00:46:36,700 --> 00:46:38,300
It couldn't be simpler.

565
00:46:44,500 --> 00:46:45,700
Emmett?

566
00:46:46,800 --> 00:46:48,100
It's Clara.

567
00:46:48,400 --> 00:46:50,700
Quick, cover the DeLorean!

568
00:46:57,400 --> 00:46:59,300
Hello.
Why, hello.

569
00:46:59,700 --> 00:47:01,900
This is quite a surprise.

570
00:47:03,200 --> 00:47:06,100
I hope I'm not disturbing anything.

571
00:47:06,200 --> 00:47:09,200
We were just doing a little model railroading.

572
00:47:11,800 --> 00:47:14,600
When my bags were thrown from the wagon...

573
00:47:14,600 --> 00:47:16,800
...my telescope was damaged.

574
00:47:17,400 --> 00:47:20,000
Since you mentioned an interest in science...

575
00:47:20,100 --> 00:47:23,000
...I thought you might be able to repair it for me.

576
00:47:23,300 --> 00:47:26,100
I would pay you, of course.

577
00:47:27,000 --> 00:47:29,400
I wouldn't think of charging you for this.

578
00:47:29,500 --> 00:47:31,200
Let's have a look at it.

579
00:47:31,600 --> 00:47:34,700
I think a lens may be out of alignment because...

580
00:47:34,800 --> 00:47:38,800
...if you move it this way the image turns fuzzy.

581
00:47:39,400 --> 00:47:40,300
See?

582
00:47:40,400 --> 00:47:43,900
But if you turn it the other way...

583
00:47:44,800 --> 00:47:45,900
...then...

584
00:47:46,100 --> 00:47:47,800
Everything becomes...

585
00:47:50,700 --> 00:47:51,700
...clear.

586
00:47:57,000 --> 00:48:00,100
I could repair it right away
and have it for you tonight.

587
00:48:00,700 --> 00:48:02,200
Tonight is the town festival.

588
00:48:02,300 --> 00:48:06,500
I wouldn't dream of having you work
on my telescope during such an occasion.

589
00:48:06,600 --> 00:48:09,900
You are planning on attending, aren't you?

590
00:48:10,800 --> 00:48:13,700
-Actually, ma'am...
-Yes, of course. The festival.

591
00:48:15,200 --> 00:48:19,500
In that case,
I'll see you this evening at the festival.

592
00:48:20,500 --> 00:48:22,400
Mr. Eastwood.
Ma'am.

593
00:48:25,500 --> 00:48:27,800
Thank you for taking care of my telescope.

594
00:48:27,800 --> 00:48:29,600
You're quite welcome.

595
00:48:35,300 --> 00:48:36,800
It's a nice telescope.

596
00:48:37,200 --> 00:48:39,000
Ladies and gentlemen...

597
00:48:39,400 --> 00:48:41,300
...as mayor of Hill Valley...

598
00:48:41,500 --> 00:48:45,200
...it gives me great pleasure
to dedicate this clock...

599
00:48:45,400 --> 00:48:47,900
...to the people of Hill County!

600
00:48:48,000 --> 00:48:50,800
May it stand for all time!

601
00:48:51,400 --> 00:48:52,800
Tell me when, gentlemen.

602
00:48:54,000 --> 00:48:57,700
Three! Two! One!

603
00:48:58,400 --> 00:48:59,600
Now!

604
00:49:04,700 --> 00:49:07,000
Let the festivities begin!

605
00:49:14,600 --> 00:49:17,900
In a way, it's fitting that you and I
are here to witness this.

606
00:49:18,000 --> 00:49:20,300
It's too bad I didn't bring my camera.

607
00:49:27,000 --> 00:49:28,400
Ready, gentlemen?

608
00:49:29,300 --> 00:49:32,600
The only problem is,
we'll never be able to show it to anybody.

609
00:49:32,700 --> 00:49:34,000
Smile, Doc.

610
00:49:57,700 --> 00:49:59,200
What great music!

611
00:50:00,000 --> 00:50:02,500
Yeah, it's got a beat, and you can dance to it.

612
00:50:02,600 --> 00:50:05,600
Step right up and test your mettle
with the latest products...

613
00:50:05,700 --> 00:50:09,400
...from Col. Samuel Colt's Patent
Firearms Manufacturing Company...

614
00:50:09,600 --> 00:50:11,300
...of Hartford, Connecticut.

615
00:50:11,400 --> 00:50:13,700
Now, take this model, for example.

616
00:50:14,100 --> 00:50:17,200
The new,
improved and refined Colt Peacemaker...

617
00:50:17,600 --> 00:50:23,000
...selling to you tonight for the low price of $12.

618
00:50:38,200 --> 00:50:40,000
-Good evening.
-'Evening.

619
00:50:41,300 --> 00:50:43,200
You look very nice.

620
00:50:43,500 --> 00:50:44,900
Thank you.

621
00:50:53,500 --> 00:50:55,100
Would you like...

622
00:50:57,000 --> 00:50:59,700
-Would you care to...
-I'd love to.

623
00:51:17,000 --> 00:51:19,200
Young man, you want to give it a try?

624
00:51:19,300 --> 00:51:20,600
No, thanks.

625
00:51:20,700 --> 00:51:22,300
Doc, this...

626
00:51:29,800 --> 00:51:31,000
Son!

627
00:51:31,600 --> 00:51:34,200
-Sonny boy!
-Doc can dance?

628
00:51:37,600 --> 00:51:38,800
Son.

629
00:51:40,400 --> 00:51:44,800
I just told you that even a baby
could handle this weapon.

630
00:51:44,900 --> 00:51:48,900
Surely you're not afraid to try.
I'm not afraid of nothing.

631
00:51:49,000 --> 00:51:51,900
Come on, then.
Just step up here like a man.

632
00:51:52,000 --> 00:51:56,300
Now, young man, what you do
is just ease that hammer back and...

633
00:51:56,800 --> 00:51:59,400
...squeeze off a round.

634
00:51:59,400 --> 00:52:02,300
Right on out there and be real smooth.

635
00:52:02,400 --> 00:52:04,200
That's the way you do it.

636
00:52:07,800 --> 00:52:11,000
-Can I try that again?
-Yeah, go ahead.

637
00:52:22,800 --> 00:52:25,900
Tell me one thing.
Where did you learn to shoot like that?

638
00:52:26,700 --> 00:52:28,100
7-Eleven.

639
00:52:32,600 --> 00:52:35,600
Buford, you sure that blacksmith
will be at this shindig?

640
00:52:35,700 --> 00:52:38,600
Sure he's here. Everybody's here tonight.

641
00:52:40,800 --> 00:52:44,800
You'll have to check your firearms
if you want to join in on the festivities.

642
00:52:46,400 --> 00:52:49,400
Who's gonna make us, tenderfoot?
I am.

643
00:52:51,800 --> 00:52:54,700
Marshal Strickland.
I didn't know you was back in town.

644
00:52:54,800 --> 00:52:58,300
If you can't read the sign,
I presume you can read this.

645
00:52:58,800 --> 00:53:01,800
Pretty tough hombre when you're pointing
a gun at a man's back.

646
00:53:01,800 --> 00:53:04,500
Just like you, I take every advantage I can get.

647
00:53:04,600 --> 00:53:06,500
You gonna check your iron?

648
00:53:07,800 --> 00:53:10,200
I was just joking with your deputy.

649
00:53:10,400 --> 00:53:12,200
Of course, I'm gonna check my iron.

650
00:53:12,400 --> 00:53:15,100
We all were, weren't we, boys?
Yeah, right.

651
00:53:16,200 --> 00:53:17,400
Tannen.

652
00:53:19,000 --> 00:53:20,900
Your knife, too.

653
00:53:27,000 --> 00:53:28,500
Smile, Marshal.

654
00:53:28,600 --> 00:53:30,300
After all, this is a party.

655
00:53:30,400 --> 00:53:32,700
Only party I'll be smiling at...

656
00:53:32,900 --> 00:53:35,700
...is the one that sees you at the end of a rope.

657
00:53:38,000 --> 00:53:39,400
Have fun!

658
00:53:42,700 --> 00:53:45,400
That's how you handle them.
Never give them an inch...

659
00:53:45,500 --> 00:53:47,600
...and maintain discipline at all times.

660
00:53:47,800 --> 00:53:50,300
Remember that word: discipline.

661
00:53:50,600 --> 00:53:52,200
I will, Pa.

662
00:53:57,600 --> 00:53:58,600
Thank you very much.

663
00:53:58,700 --> 00:54:02,700
Mr. Eastwood, nice to see you.

664
00:54:03,100 --> 00:54:07,100
I see you got yourself
some respectable clothes and a fine hat.

665
00:54:07,400 --> 00:54:10,700
A couple people didn't like the way
the other one looked on me.

666
00:54:10,800 --> 00:54:12,400
That one suits you.

667
00:54:12,500 --> 00:54:14,400
-It's very becoming.
-Thanks.

668
00:54:15,500 --> 00:54:17,900
"Frisbee." Far out.

669
00:54:20,600 --> 00:54:24,000
-What was the meaning of that?
-It was right in front of him.

670
00:54:37,800 --> 00:54:39,400
-That's mine!
-Not anymore.

671
00:54:39,400 --> 00:54:42,200
-Give me that.
-There he is, Buford.

672
00:54:43,500 --> 00:54:44,800
-Where?
-There.

673
00:54:45,200 --> 00:54:47,300
Dancing with that piece of calico.

674
00:54:47,400 --> 00:54:49,300
What are you gonna do, boss?

675
00:54:51,500 --> 00:54:56,200
I figure if I bury this muzzle deep enough
in his back nobody will hear the shot.

676
00:54:56,500 --> 00:54:58,700
Careful. You've only got one bullet with that.

677
00:54:58,800 --> 00:55:00,500
I only need one.

678
00:55:11,400 --> 00:55:14,000
I told you to watch your back, smithy.

679
00:55:14,300 --> 00:55:15,700
You're early.

680
00:55:15,800 --> 00:55:17,900
It's a Derringer. Small but effective.

681
00:55:18,000 --> 00:55:20,600
The last time I used it, fella took two days to die.

682
00:55:20,700 --> 00:55:23,600
Bled to death inside. It was real painful.

683
00:55:23,700 --> 00:55:26,800
That means you'll be dead
by about supper time Monday.

684
00:55:26,900 --> 00:55:30,000
Excuse me. I don't know
who you think you are, but we're dancing.

685
00:55:30,100 --> 00:55:32,400
Look what we have here.

686
00:55:32,500 --> 00:55:35,200
Ain't you gonna introduce me?
I'd like a dance.

687
00:55:35,300 --> 00:55:38,700
I wouldn't give you the pleasure.
You'll have to go ahead and shoot.

688
00:55:38,900 --> 00:55:41,200
-All right.
-I'll dance with him.

689
00:55:41,300 --> 00:55:45,200
Boys, keep the blacksmith company
while I get acquainted with the filly!

690
00:55:47,200 --> 00:55:48,700
Yeah!

691
00:55:50,800 --> 00:55:53,800
I don't dance very well
when my partner has a gun in his hand.

692
00:55:53,800 --> 00:55:55,200
You'll learn.

693
00:55:57,400 --> 00:55:59,600
Maybe I'll just take
my $80 worth out of her!

694
00:55:59,700 --> 00:56:01,400
Leave her alone!

695
00:56:04,300 --> 00:56:07,800
Yeah, I bet there's something you can do
that's worth $80.

696
00:56:09,000 --> 00:56:11,300
I believe you've underestimated me, mister.

697
00:56:11,400 --> 00:56:12,900
Have I?

698
00:56:19,600 --> 00:56:21,000
Stop it!

699
00:56:21,300 --> 00:56:22,500
Damn you!

700
00:56:24,100 --> 00:56:25,600
No, I damn you!

701
00:56:26,700 --> 00:56:29,300
I damn you to hell!

702
00:56:35,900 --> 00:56:38,500
-You.
-Lighten up, jerk!

703
00:56:42,400 --> 00:56:44,200
Mighty strong words, runt!

704
00:56:44,700 --> 00:56:48,200
You man enough to back them up
with more than just a pie plate?

705
00:56:50,500 --> 00:56:52,500
Just leave my friends alone.

706
00:56:53,300 --> 00:56:55,600
What's wrong, dude? You yellow?

707
00:57:03,200 --> 00:57:06,000
That's what I thought. A yellow-belly.

708
00:57:11,800 --> 00:57:14,400
Nobody calls me yellow.

709
00:57:15,300 --> 00:57:18,300
Then let's finish it. Right now.

710
00:57:18,400 --> 00:57:20,700
Not now, Buford. Marshal's got our guns.

711
00:57:21,200 --> 00:57:23,200
Like I said, we'll finish this tomorrow!

712
00:57:23,300 --> 00:57:25,800
Tomorrow we're robbing the Pine City stage.

713
00:57:26,200 --> 00:57:28,400
What about Monday?
We doing anything Monday?

714
00:57:28,600 --> 00:57:30,900
Monday would be fine.
You can kill him on Monday.

715
00:57:31,000 --> 00:57:34,200
I'll be back this way on Monday.
We'll settle this then.

716
00:57:34,700 --> 00:57:37,100
Right there, out in the street...

717
00:57:37,600 --> 00:57:39,600
...in front of the Palace Saloon.

718
00:57:40,300 --> 00:57:42,400
Yeah, right. When?

719
00:57:42,400 --> 00:57:44,400
High noon?
Noon?

720
00:57:44,700 --> 00:57:48,500
I do my killing before breakfast. 7:00!

721
00:57:50,700 --> 00:57:55,200
8:00. I do my killing after breakfast.

722
00:57:55,200 --> 00:57:57,000
Marty!

723
00:58:01,200 --> 00:58:02,300
Break it up.

724
00:58:02,400 --> 00:58:05,400
What's all this about?
You causing trouble here, Tannen?

725
00:58:05,800 --> 00:58:07,400
No trouble, Marshal.

726
00:58:08,000 --> 00:58:11,100
Just a little personal matter
between me and Eastwood.

727
00:58:11,400 --> 00:58:12,800
This don't concern the law.

728
00:58:12,900 --> 00:58:15,600
Tonight, everything concerns the law.
Break it up.

729
00:58:15,700 --> 00:58:19,200
Any brawling, it's 15 days in the county jail.

730
00:58:19,300 --> 00:58:23,400
All right, folks. This is a party.
Come on! Let's have some fun!

731
00:58:28,200 --> 00:58:29,700
8:00 Monday, runt.

732
00:58:30,400 --> 00:58:34,700
If you ain't here, I'll hunt you
and shoot you down like a duck.

733
00:58:35,800 --> 00:58:38,100
It's "dog." Shoot him down like a dog.

734
00:58:39,100 --> 00:58:40,600
Let's go, boys!

735
00:58:41,200 --> 00:58:43,400
Let these sissies have their party!

736
00:58:44,500 --> 00:58:47,100
What are you doing, saying you'll meet Tannen?

737
00:58:47,200 --> 00:58:51,300
Don't worry about it.
Monday morning we'll be gone.

738
00:58:51,400 --> 00:58:54,100
Theoretically, yes. But what if the train's late?

739
00:58:54,300 --> 00:58:56,600
-We'll discuss this later.
-We'll discuss it now.

740
00:58:56,700 --> 00:58:59,100
-Thank you for your gallantry.
-Ma'am.

741
00:58:59,200 --> 00:59:01,800
Had you not interceded,
Emmett might have been shot.

742
00:59:01,800 --> 00:59:04,500
Marty... Clint, I'm gonna take Clara home.

743
00:59:04,600 --> 00:59:06,900
-Right. Good night.
-You sure set him straight.

744
00:59:07,000 --> 00:59:10,000
I'm glad somebody finally stood up
to that son of a bitch.

745
00:59:10,100 --> 00:59:13,000
You're all right in my book.
I'd like to buy you a drink.

746
00:59:13,100 --> 00:59:16,200
You don't have to buy me anything.
It was no big deal...

747
00:59:16,400 --> 00:59:20,400
You can have this brand-new
Colt Peacemaker and gun belt, free of charge.

748
00:59:21,800 --> 00:59:23,000
Free?

749
00:59:23,100 --> 00:59:26,200
I want everybody to know
the gun that shot Buford Tannen...

750
00:59:26,300 --> 00:59:28,200
...was a Colt Peacemaker!

751
00:59:28,400 --> 00:59:30,200
No problem. Thanks a lot.

752
00:59:30,900 --> 00:59:34,800
Of course, if you lose, I'm taking it back.

753
00:59:37,800 --> 00:59:39,200
Thanks again.

754
00:59:42,400 --> 00:59:43,600
You had him.

755
00:59:44,000 --> 00:59:47,200
You could have walked away and nobody
would have thought less of you.

756
00:59:47,300 --> 00:59:50,400
All it would have been was words,
hot air from a buffoon.

757
00:59:51,400 --> 00:59:53,100
Instead, you let him rile you...

758
00:59:53,200 --> 00:59:57,000
...into playing his game, his way, by his rules.

759
00:59:57,200 --> 00:59:59,400
Seamus, relax. I know what I'm doing.

760
00:59:59,500 --> 01:00:01,300
-He reminds me of poor Martin.
-Aye.

761
01:00:01,400 --> 01:00:02,800
-Who?
-Me brother.

762
01:00:02,800 --> 01:00:05,700
Wait a minute.
You have a brother named Martin McFly?

763
01:00:05,800 --> 01:00:07,100
Had a brother.

764
01:00:08,100 --> 01:00:10,700
Martin used to let men
provoke him into fighting.

765
01:00:10,800 --> 01:00:13,800
He was concerned people
would think him a coward if he refused.

766
01:00:13,800 --> 01:00:18,400
That's how he got a knife shoved through
his belly in a saloon in Virginia City.

767
01:00:18,800 --> 01:00:22,600
Never considered the future, poor Martin.
God rest his soul.

768
01:00:24,000 --> 01:00:27,200
Sure, and I hope you're
considering the future, Mr. Eastwood.

769
01:00:30,900 --> 01:00:33,000
I think about it all the time.

770
01:00:34,100 --> 01:00:38,200
That crater all by itself, like a starburst.

771
01:00:38,300 --> 01:00:40,800
Yeah.
That one's called Copernicus.

772
01:00:41,600 --> 01:00:45,300
Listen to me. I feel like I'm teaching school.

773
01:00:45,500 --> 01:00:47,400
Please, continue the lesson.

774
01:00:47,900 --> 01:00:50,600
I never found lunar geography so fascinating.

775
01:00:50,900 --> 01:00:52,600
You're quite knowledgeable.

776
01:00:53,000 --> 01:00:56,600
When I was 11, I had diphtheria.
I was quarantined for three months.

777
01:00:56,700 --> 01:01:00,100
My father brought this telescope
and put it next to my bed...

778
01:01:00,200 --> 01:01:02,400
...so I could see everything out the window.

779
01:01:03,800 --> 01:01:07,000
Do you think we'll ever travel to the moon...

780
01:01:07,100 --> 01:01:09,900
...the way we travel
across the country on trains?

781
01:01:10,000 --> 01:01:13,200
Definitely. Although not for 84 years,
and not on trains.

782
01:01:13,300 --> 01:01:16,800
We'll have space capsules sent aloft
with rockets...

783
01:01:17,300 --> 01:01:21,200
...devices that create giant explosions
so powerful they just...

784
01:01:21,300 --> 01:01:25,800
That they break the pull of gravity
and send the projectile to outer space.

785
01:01:27,700 --> 01:01:28,900
Emmett!

786
01:01:29,000 --> 01:01:30,400
I read that book, too!

787
01:01:30,500 --> 01:01:33,800
You're quoting Jules Verne,
From the Earth to the Moon.

788
01:01:33,900 --> 01:01:35,900
You've read Jules Verne?

789
01:01:36,400 --> 01:01:39,900
-I adore Jules Verne.
-So do I.

790
01:01:40,200 --> 01:01:43,200
20,000 Leagues Under the Sea.
My absolute favorite.

791
01:01:43,200 --> 01:01:47,400
The first time I read that as a little boy,
I wanted to meet Captain Nemo.

792
01:01:47,500 --> 01:01:50,600
Don't tease. You couldn't have read that
when you were a boy.

793
01:01:50,700 --> 01:01:53,200
It was only first published 10 years ago.

794
01:01:53,300 --> 01:01:57,700
Yes. I meant it made me feel like a boy.

795
01:01:59,200 --> 01:02:03,800
I never met a woman
who liked Jules Verne before.

796
01:02:05,700 --> 01:02:09,000
I never ever met a man like you before.

797
01:02:58,800 --> 01:03:00,000
Doc?

798
01:03:04,500 --> 01:03:05,700
Doc?

799
01:03:09,000 --> 01:03:10,900
Hope you know what you're doing.

800
01:03:23,700 --> 01:03:25,600
You talking to me?

801
01:03:28,000 --> 01:03:29,900
You talking to me, Tannen?

802
01:03:33,900 --> 01:03:35,500
I'm the only one here.

803
01:03:36,500 --> 01:03:39,900
Go ahead! Make my day.

804
01:03:46,200 --> 01:03:48,500
Good morning.
'Morning.

805
01:03:49,100 --> 01:03:53,000
Have a cigar. Anything I can do for you today?

806
01:03:53,200 --> 01:03:56,200
-No, that's fine.
-Good luck tomorrow.

807
01:03:56,300 --> 01:03:59,000
-We'll be praying for you.
-Thanks.

808
01:04:00,100 --> 01:04:04,200
Good morning.
Interest you in a new suit for tomorrow?

809
01:04:05,200 --> 01:04:08,200
I'm fine. Thanks.

810
01:04:20,200 --> 01:04:22,000
What are you doing?
Nothing.

811
01:04:22,100 --> 01:04:24,400
I was just out enjoying the morning air.

812
01:04:24,500 --> 01:04:27,100
It's really lovely here in the morning.
Don't you think?

813
01:04:27,200 --> 01:04:31,000
Yes. We've got to load the DeLorean
and get ready to roll.

814
01:04:31,100 --> 01:04:33,600
Look at that, the tombstone.

815
01:04:35,200 --> 01:04:37,400
Let me see that photograph again.

816
01:04:39,900 --> 01:04:41,800
My name, it's vanished.

817
01:04:42,200 --> 01:04:43,800
That's great, Doc.

818
01:04:43,800 --> 01:04:47,100
We're going back to the future tomorrow,
so everything's being erased.

819
01:04:47,200 --> 01:04:48,800
But only my name is erased.

820
01:04:48,900 --> 01:04:52,400
The tombstone itself and the date still remain.
That doesn't make sense.

821
01:04:52,500 --> 01:04:55,000
We know this photograph represents
what will happen...

822
01:04:55,100 --> 01:04:58,400
...if the events of today continue
to run their course into tomorrow.

823
01:04:58,400 --> 01:05:00,600
-Right. So?
-Excuse me, Mr. Eastwood.

824
01:05:00,700 --> 01:05:04,900
-I just need to take your measurements.
-Look, pal, I don't want to buy a suit.

825
01:05:05,200 --> 01:05:08,300
-This is for your coffin.
-My coffin?

826
01:05:08,400 --> 01:05:11,000
The odds are running 2-1 against you.

827
01:05:11,100 --> 01:05:13,000
Might as well be prepared.

828
01:05:13,200 --> 01:05:15,000
So it may not be my name...

829
01:05:15,100 --> 01:05:18,500
...that's going to be on this tombstone.
It may be yours.

830
01:05:19,400 --> 01:05:21,600
-Great Scott.
-I know, this is heavy.

831
01:05:21,800 --> 01:05:25,700
Why are you wearing that gun? You're
not considering going up against Tannen?

832
01:05:25,800 --> 01:05:28,400
Tomorrow morning I'm going
back to the future with you.

833
01:05:28,500 --> 01:05:31,600
But if Buford Tannen comes looking for trouble,
I'll be ready for him.

834
01:05:31,700 --> 01:05:33,900
You heard what that son of a bitch called me.

835
01:05:34,000 --> 01:05:36,700
You can't lose your judgment over names.

836
01:05:36,800 --> 01:05:40,600
That's exactly what causes you
to get in that accident in the future.

837
01:05:42,300 --> 01:05:45,400
What? What about my future?

838
01:05:46,100 --> 01:05:49,100
I can't tell you. It might make things worse.

839
01:05:49,200 --> 01:05:50,700
Wait a minute.

840
01:05:51,000 --> 01:05:53,000
What is wrong with my future?

841
01:05:53,600 --> 01:05:57,600
We all have to make decisions
that affect the course of our lives.

842
01:05:58,400 --> 01:06:00,900
You've got to do what you've got to do...

843
01:06:01,100 --> 01:06:03,500
...and I've got to do what I've got to do.

844
01:06:13,900 --> 01:06:15,500
-Marty.
-Yeah?

845
01:06:15,800 --> 01:06:17,600
I've made a decision.

846
01:06:17,700 --> 01:06:19,800
I'm not going with you tomorrow.

847
01:06:19,900 --> 01:06:21,800
I'm staying here.

848
01:06:24,800 --> 01:06:26,800
What are you talking about?

849
01:06:27,400 --> 01:06:29,300
There's no point in denying it.

850
01:06:29,400 --> 01:06:31,800
-I'm in love with Clara.
-Oh, man.

851
01:06:32,000 --> 01:06:33,800
We don't belong here.

852
01:06:34,300 --> 01:06:35,900
Neither one of us.

853
01:06:36,000 --> 01:06:38,700
It could still be you that gets shot tomorrow.

854
01:06:38,800 --> 01:06:41,400
This tombstone could still be in your future.

855
01:06:41,400 --> 01:06:43,800
Marty, the future isn't written.

856
01:06:44,700 --> 01:06:47,300
It can be changed. You know that.

857
01:06:48,000 --> 01:06:51,700
Anyone can make their future
whatever they want it to be.

858
01:06:52,000 --> 01:06:55,700
I can't let this one little photograph
determine my entire destiny.

859
01:06:56,100 --> 01:07:00,000
I have to live my life
according to what I believe is right...

860
01:07:00,000 --> 01:07:01,200
...in my heart.

861
01:07:03,300 --> 01:07:06,400
Doc, you're a scientist.

862
01:07:08,000 --> 01:07:12,400
So you tell me.
What's the right thing to do, up here?

863
01:07:25,700 --> 01:07:27,200
You're right, Marty.

864
01:07:48,900 --> 01:07:52,300
-That worked great.
-I've at least got to tell her good-bye.

865
01:07:53,800 --> 01:07:55,000
Come on, Doc.

866
01:07:56,200 --> 01:07:58,100
Think about it. What will you say to her?

867
01:07:58,200 --> 01:08:01,700
"I've got to go back to the future"?
She won't understand that.

868
01:08:01,800 --> 01:08:04,800
Hell, I'm in it with you,
and I don't even understand it.

869
01:08:07,700 --> 01:08:08,600
Doc.

870
01:08:09,300 --> 01:08:10,500
Listen.

871
01:08:11,800 --> 01:08:13,200
Maybe we...

872
01:08:13,500 --> 01:08:16,000
Maybe we can just take Clara with us.

873
01:08:17,800 --> 01:08:19,000
To the future?

874
01:08:23,300 --> 01:08:27,600
As you reminded me, I'm a scientist,
so I must be scientific about this.

875
01:08:28,500 --> 01:08:31,700
I cautioned you about disrupting
the continuum for your own benefit.

876
01:08:31,800 --> 01:08:33,600
Therefore, I must do no less.

877
01:08:34,000 --> 01:08:37,200
We shall proceed as planned,
and as soon as we return to 1985...

878
01:08:37,200 --> 01:08:39,500
...we'll destroy this infernal machine.

879
01:08:40,500 --> 01:08:43,300
Traveling through time
has become much too painful.

880
01:09:13,000 --> 01:09:14,700
It's Emmett, Clara.

881
01:09:18,700 --> 01:09:21,200
Emmett, won't you come in?

882
01:09:21,800 --> 01:09:24,200
No, I better not. I...

883
01:09:26,600 --> 01:09:28,000
What's wrong?

884
01:09:29,200 --> 01:09:30,800
I've come to say good-bye.

885
01:09:32,400 --> 01:09:34,600
Good-bye? Where are you going?

886
01:09:35,600 --> 01:09:36,800
I'm going away.

887
01:09:37,700 --> 01:09:40,200
I'm afraid I'll never see you again.

888
01:09:41,400 --> 01:09:42,300
Emmett.

889
01:09:42,700 --> 01:09:47,700
Clara, I want you to know
that I care about you deeply.

890
01:09:48,700 --> 01:09:52,800
But I've realized that I don't belong here,
and I have to go back where I came from.

891
01:09:54,000 --> 01:09:55,700
Where might that be?

892
01:09:56,600 --> 01:09:58,300
I can't tell you.

893
01:10:02,000 --> 01:10:04,300
Then wherever you're going, take me with you.

894
01:10:05,300 --> 01:10:06,500
I can't, Clara.

895
01:10:07,400 --> 01:10:09,300
I wish it didn't have to be this way...

896
01:10:09,400 --> 01:10:12,400
...but believe me when I tell you
that I'll never forget you...

897
01:10:12,500 --> 01:10:14,800
...and that I love you.

898
01:10:16,800 --> 01:10:19,000
I don't understand what you're trying to say.

899
01:10:19,000 --> 01:10:20,000
Clara.

900
01:10:20,600 --> 01:10:23,300
I don't think there's any way
that you can understand it.

901
01:10:23,400 --> 01:10:25,400
Please, I have to know.

902
01:10:25,900 --> 01:10:29,200
If you sincerely do love me,
then tell me the truth.

903
01:10:30,700 --> 01:10:31,900
All right then.

904
01:10:33,300 --> 01:10:35,000
I'm from the future.

905
01:10:36,400 --> 01:10:39,300
I came here in a time machine
that I invented...

906
01:10:39,400 --> 01:10:43,300
...and tomorrow I have to go back
to the year 1985.

907
01:10:49,400 --> 01:10:50,600
Yes, Emmett.

908
01:10:52,000 --> 01:10:53,300
I do understand.

909
01:10:56,000 --> 01:11:00,500
I understand that because you know
I'm partial to the writings of Jules Verne...

910
01:11:00,600 --> 01:11:04,300
...you concocted those mendacities
in order to take advantage of me.

911
01:11:05,100 --> 01:11:07,100
I've heard some whoppers in my day...

912
01:11:07,200 --> 01:11:10,000
...but the fact that you'd expect me
to believe this...

913
01:11:10,100 --> 01:11:12,800
...is so insulting and degrading!

914
01:11:14,200 --> 01:11:18,000
All you had to say is, "I don't love you
and I don't want to see you anymore."

915
01:11:18,000 --> 01:11:20,700
That, at least, would have been respectful!

916
01:11:21,300 --> 01:11:22,800
But that's not the truth.

917
01:12:00,600 --> 01:12:02,000
Good to see you, too.

918
01:12:03,700 --> 01:12:07,100
Emmett. What can I get you, the usual?

919
01:12:07,200 --> 01:12:10,800
No, Chester, I'll need something
a lot stronger than that tonight.

920
01:12:10,800 --> 01:12:13,600
-Sarsaparilla.
-Whiskey, Chester.

921
01:12:14,400 --> 01:12:16,600
Whiskey? Are you sure?

922
01:12:16,700 --> 01:12:19,100
You know what happened to you
on the Fourth of July.

923
01:12:19,200 --> 01:12:20,400
Whiskey.

924
01:12:21,800 --> 01:12:23,700
Okay, I ain't your papa.

925
01:12:24,700 --> 01:12:27,800
Just don't want to see you do the wrong thing.

926
01:12:29,000 --> 01:12:31,000
You can leave the bottle.

927
01:12:32,900 --> 01:12:34,600
It's a woman, right?

928
01:12:36,100 --> 01:12:38,400
I knew it. I've seen that look
on a man's face...

929
01:12:38,600 --> 01:12:40,900
...a thousand times all across the country.

930
01:12:41,000 --> 01:12:44,300
All I can tell you, friend,
is you'll get over her.

931
01:12:45,000 --> 01:12:47,000
Clara was one in a million.

932
01:12:48,000 --> 01:12:51,600
One in a billion. One in a googolplex.

933
01:12:52,200 --> 01:12:55,600
The woman of my dreams,
and I've lost her for all time.

934
01:12:56,800 --> 01:12:59,800
I can assure you, sir, there are other women.

935
01:13:00,100 --> 01:13:02,600
Peddling this barbed wire
across the country...

936
01:13:02,600 --> 01:13:05,100
...has taught me one thing for certain...

937
01:13:05,200 --> 01:13:08,100
...it's that you never know
what the future might bring.

938
01:13:08,200 --> 01:13:11,900
The future. I can tell you about the future.

939
01:13:22,300 --> 01:13:24,000
Man, did I sleep.

940
01:13:26,800 --> 01:13:28,600
What time is it, Doc?

941
01:13:32,300 --> 01:13:33,200
Doc!

942
01:13:44,100 --> 01:13:45,300
Wake up!

943
01:13:47,200 --> 01:13:49,000
Get up! Let's go!

944
01:13:50,200 --> 01:13:52,000
I got me a runt to kill.

945
01:13:52,200 --> 01:13:55,000
It's still early, boss. What's your hurry?

946
01:13:56,100 --> 01:13:57,100
I'm hungry.

947
01:13:58,000 --> 01:14:01,600
And in the future, we don't need horses.

948
01:14:02,700 --> 01:14:05,800
We have motorized carriages
called automobiles.

949
01:14:07,100 --> 01:14:10,100
If everybody's got one of these auto whatsits...

950
01:14:10,300 --> 01:14:12,800
...does anybody walk or run anymore?

951
01:14:13,400 --> 01:14:17,000
Of course they run, but for recreation, for fun.

952
01:14:17,200 --> 01:14:20,700
Run for fun?
What the hell kind of fun is that?

953
01:14:30,600 --> 01:14:32,700
Doc!

954
01:14:39,200 --> 01:14:41,000
How much has he had?

955
01:14:41,000 --> 01:14:44,200
None. That's the first one,
and he hasn't touched it yet.

956
01:14:44,900 --> 01:14:46,400
He just likes to hold it.

957
01:14:49,800 --> 01:14:51,200
Doc!

958
01:14:51,900 --> 01:14:53,200
What are you doing?

959
01:14:53,700 --> 01:14:56,800
I've lost her, Marty.
There's nothing left for me here.

960
01:14:56,900 --> 01:14:58,600
That's why you gotta come back with me.

961
01:14:58,800 --> 01:15:01,000
-Where?
-Back to the future!

962
01:15:05,000 --> 01:15:07,600
-Right! Let's get going!
-Great.

963
01:15:08,200 --> 01:15:11,400
Gentlemen, excuse me.
My friend and I have to catch a train.

964
01:15:11,400 --> 01:15:13,000
Here's to you, blacksmith.

965
01:15:13,000 --> 01:15:15,300
-And to the future.
-Amen.

966
01:15:15,800 --> 01:15:17,800
-Amen.
-Emmett, no!

967
01:15:25,000 --> 01:15:26,600
Doc!

968
01:15:28,800 --> 01:15:31,700
Come on, Doc. Wake up! Wake up, Doc!

969
01:15:32,800 --> 01:15:35,200
-How many did he have?
-Just the one.

970
01:15:35,300 --> 01:15:39,200
-Just the one? Come on, Doc.
-There's a fellow that can't hold his liquor.

971
01:15:39,200 --> 01:15:42,000
-Get me some black coffee!
-Joey, coffee!

972
01:15:51,800 --> 01:15:53,000
Ma'am?

973
01:15:53,600 --> 01:15:57,800
-How far does the 8:00 train go?
-San Francisco is the end of the line.

974
01:15:59,500 --> 01:16:01,200
I'll take a one-way ticket.

975
01:16:02,800 --> 01:16:07,000
To sober him up in a hurry,
you need something a lot stronger than coffee.

976
01:16:07,100 --> 01:16:08,600
What do you suggest?

977
01:16:09,400 --> 01:16:12,500
Joey, let's make some wake-up juice.

978
01:16:12,600 --> 01:16:14,400
Come on, Doc, swallow.

979
01:16:20,000 --> 01:16:21,400
In about 10 minutes...

980
01:16:22,100 --> 01:16:25,400
...he's gonna be as sober as a priest on Sunday.

981
01:16:25,900 --> 01:16:26,900
Ten minutes!

982
01:16:27,200 --> 01:16:29,600
Why do we cut these things so damn close?

983
01:16:29,600 --> 01:16:32,100
Here, stick this clothespin on his nose.

984
01:16:33,900 --> 01:16:38,000
When he opens up his mouth,
go ahead and pour it on down his gullet.

985
01:16:39,200 --> 01:16:40,600
Stand back.

986
01:16:58,700 --> 01:17:01,800
-He's still out!
-That was just a reflex action.

987
01:17:02,100 --> 01:17:05,400
It'll take a few more minutes
for the stuff to clear up his head.

988
01:17:05,500 --> 01:17:06,400
Perfect.

989
01:17:26,800 --> 01:17:29,000
Come on, Doc. Wake up, buddy.

990
01:17:29,100 --> 01:17:30,400
Wake up, Doc!

991
01:17:31,800 --> 01:17:34,500
Seamus?
Wouldn't expect to see you here this morning.

992
01:17:34,600 --> 01:17:38,000
Aye. Something inside me told me
I should be here...

993
01:17:39,200 --> 01:17:41,900
...as if my future had something to do with it.

994
01:17:43,900 --> 01:17:46,600
He'll come around in a minute. Come on.

995
01:17:46,700 --> 01:17:49,200
Come on, Doc. Let's go!
Let's wake up now, buddy.

996
01:17:56,900 --> 01:17:58,700
Are you in there, Eastwood?

997
01:18:00,900 --> 01:18:04,100
It's 8:00 and I'm calling you out.

998
01:18:08,700 --> 01:18:10,200
It's not 8:00 yet!

999
01:18:10,700 --> 01:18:12,300
It is by my watch!

1000
01:18:12,600 --> 01:18:15,400
Let's settle this once and for all, runt!

1001
01:18:16,900 --> 01:18:19,100
Or ain't you got the gumption?

1002
01:18:28,200 --> 01:18:29,500
Listen.

1003
01:18:31,800 --> 01:18:34,200
I'm not really feeling up to this today.

1004
01:18:36,000 --> 01:18:40,300
-So I'll have to forfeit.
-Forfeit?

1005
01:18:41,300 --> 01:18:42,600
What's that mean?

1006
01:18:43,900 --> 01:18:47,900
-It means that you win without a fight.
-Without shooting? He can't do that.

1007
01:18:48,000 --> 01:18:49,300
You can't do that!

1008
01:18:50,100 --> 01:18:51,600
You know what I think?

1009
01:18:51,700 --> 01:18:55,000
I think you ain't nothing but a gutless,
yellow turd!

1010
01:18:55,100 --> 01:18:59,100
I'm giving you to the count of 10
to come out here and prove I'm wrong!

1011
01:19:00,000 --> 01:19:01,100
One!

1012
01:19:01,500 --> 01:19:04,000
Doc, come on, sober up, buddy.

1013
01:19:04,100 --> 01:19:06,400
Two!
You better get out there, son.

1014
01:19:06,400 --> 01:19:09,600
I got $20 gold bet on you, so don't let me down.

1015
01:19:09,700 --> 01:19:10,600
Three!

1016
01:19:10,600 --> 01:19:14,800
I got $30 gold bet against you,
so don't let me down.

1017
01:19:14,900 --> 01:19:15,700
Four!

1018
01:19:15,800 --> 01:19:20,200
You better face up to it, son,
because if you don't go out there...

1019
01:19:20,200 --> 01:19:21,600
What?
Five!

1020
01:19:23,000 --> 01:19:26,000
-What if I don't go out there?
-You're a coward.

1021
01:19:26,000 --> 01:19:26,900
Six!

1022
01:19:27,100 --> 01:19:30,000
And you'll be branded a coward
for the rest of your days!

1023
01:19:30,200 --> 01:19:34,200
Everybody everywhere will say Clint Eastwood...

1024
01:19:34,200 --> 01:19:36,900
...is the biggest yellow-belly in the West!

1025
01:19:41,800 --> 01:19:43,200
Seven!

1026
01:19:43,700 --> 01:19:44,600
Here!

1027
01:19:48,800 --> 01:19:49,900
Eight!

1028
01:19:58,400 --> 01:19:59,800
I already got a gun.

1029
01:20:01,500 --> 01:20:02,600
Nine!

1030
01:20:07,500 --> 01:20:08,600
Ten!

1031
01:20:13,300 --> 01:20:14,900
Do you hear me, runt?

1032
01:20:15,000 --> 01:20:18,500
I said that's 10,
you gutless, yellow pie-slinger!

1033
01:20:22,600 --> 01:20:24,000
He's an asshole!

1034
01:20:24,700 --> 01:20:26,700
I don't care what Tannen says!

1035
01:20:26,800 --> 01:20:29,300
I don't care what anybody else says either.

1036
01:20:30,600 --> 01:20:33,700
Doc, you okay?
I think so.

1037
01:20:34,300 --> 01:20:35,700
What a headache!

1038
01:20:35,800 --> 01:20:38,400
-You got a back door to this place?
-It's in the back.

1039
01:20:38,500 --> 01:20:39,600
Let's go.

1040
01:20:40,000 --> 01:20:43,400
Are you coming out here
or do I have to come in after you?

1041
01:20:44,700 --> 01:20:47,200
The thing I really miss here is Tylenol.

1042
01:20:47,800 --> 01:20:48,700
Hey!

1043
01:20:54,400 --> 01:20:56,000
Reach, blacksmith!

1044
01:21:12,100 --> 01:21:14,800
Yes, sir, that poor fellow last night...

1045
01:21:14,800 --> 01:21:18,400
...had the worst case of broken heart
I have ever seen.

1046
01:21:18,400 --> 01:21:21,600
When he said he didn't know
how he could live the rest of his life...

1047
01:21:21,700 --> 01:21:24,400
...knowing how much hurt
he'd caused that little girl...

1048
01:21:24,500 --> 01:21:28,200
...I really felt for him, I did, right here.

1049
01:21:33,000 --> 01:21:34,700
Listen up, Eastwood!

1050
01:21:34,800 --> 01:21:38,000
I aim to shoot somebody today,
and I prefer it'd be you.

1051
01:21:38,100 --> 01:21:40,200
But if you're just too damn yellow...

1052
01:21:40,600 --> 01:21:42,900
...it'll just have to be your blacksmith friend.

1053
01:21:43,000 --> 01:21:45,900
Forget about me, Marty, and save yourself!

1054
01:21:50,200 --> 01:21:54,600
You got one minute to decide.
You hear me, runt? One minute!

1055
01:21:57,700 --> 01:22:00,500
I've never seen a man so broken up
over a woman:

1056
01:22:00,600 --> 01:22:03,200
What did he say her name was?
Cara? Sara?

1057
01:22:03,200 --> 01:22:04,400
-Clara.
-Clara.

1058
01:22:07,900 --> 01:22:09,500
-Excuse me.
-Ma'am?

1059
01:22:10,400 --> 01:22:13,700
Was this man tall,
with great big brown puppy-dog eyes...

1060
01:22:13,800 --> 01:22:15,800
...and long silvery, flowing hair?

1061
01:22:16,400 --> 01:22:17,700
You know him.

1062
01:22:20,400 --> 01:22:21,800
Emmett!

1063
01:22:35,500 --> 01:22:37,300
Time's up, runt!

1064
01:22:43,300 --> 01:22:45,600
Prepare to meet your maker, blacksmith.

1065
01:22:46,000 --> 01:22:47,800
Right here, Tannen!

1066
01:23:24,100 --> 01:23:25,200
Draw!

1067
01:23:28,400 --> 01:23:29,300
No!

1068
01:23:44,000 --> 01:23:46,400
I thought we could settle this like men.

1069
01:23:48,000 --> 01:23:50,000
You thought wrong, dude.

1070
01:24:11,400 --> 01:24:12,800
Thank you.

1071
01:25:13,800 --> 01:25:15,300
That was good.

1072
01:25:18,000 --> 01:25:19,800
You know what I think?

1073
01:25:20,100 --> 01:25:22,000
-I think Buford's going to jail.
-Yeah.

1074
01:25:27,700 --> 01:25:29,600
Get him out of that shit.

1075
01:25:30,000 --> 01:25:31,200
Get them!

1076
01:25:35,300 --> 01:25:39,800
Buford Tannen, you're under arrest
for robbing the Pine City stage.

1077
01:25:40,000 --> 01:25:41,600
You got anything to say?

1078
01:25:46,600 --> 01:25:48,300
I hate manure.

1079
01:25:48,700 --> 01:25:49,700
Look!

1080
01:25:53,200 --> 01:25:54,400
Yes!

1081
01:25:55,700 --> 01:25:57,900
-The train!
-Can we make it?

1082
01:25:58,000 --> 01:26:00,200
We'll have to cut them off at Coyote Pass.

1083
01:26:02,400 --> 01:26:04,600
Hey, mister. Mr. Eastwood.

1084
01:26:05,000 --> 01:26:07,600
-Here's your gun, mister.
-Thanks, kid.

1085
01:26:12,400 --> 01:26:13,400
Seamus.

1086
01:26:15,100 --> 01:26:17,500
It's worth $12. Never been used.

1087
01:26:18,400 --> 01:26:22,500
Maybe I'll trade it for a new hat.
Right! Take care of that baby!

1088
01:26:24,100 --> 01:26:25,300
I will!

1089
01:26:31,500 --> 01:26:32,500
Emmett!

1090
01:26:35,000 --> 01:26:36,000
Emmett!

1091
01:26:37,600 --> 01:26:38,600
Emmett!

1092
01:26:43,200 --> 01:26:44,600
"Time machine."

1093
01:27:26,700 --> 01:27:28,100
Come on!

1094
01:27:31,400 --> 01:27:33,600
Go!
Give me your hand!

1095
01:28:02,900 --> 01:28:04,100
Come on!

1096
01:28:08,100 --> 01:28:09,600
Come on, Marty.

1097
01:28:13,800 --> 01:28:15,200
Come on. Let's go!

1098
01:28:23,600 --> 01:28:25,200
Masks on.

1099
01:28:39,300 --> 01:28:41,800
Reach!
Is this a holdup?

1100
01:28:43,500 --> 01:28:45,600
It's a science experiment.

1101
01:28:45,600 --> 01:28:48,600
Stop the train just before you hit
the switch track up ahead.

1102
01:29:03,800 --> 01:29:07,000
Doc!
Uncouple the cars from the tender!

1103
01:29:32,500 --> 01:29:34,700
I've wanted to do that all my life.

1104
01:30:07,000 --> 01:30:08,400
What are these things?

1105
01:30:08,400 --> 01:30:11,600
My version of Presto Logs.
Compressed wood with anthracite dust...

1106
01:30:11,700 --> 01:30:13,700
...chemically treated to burn hotter and longer.

1107
01:30:13,800 --> 01:30:16,000
I use them so I don't have to stoke my forge.

1108
01:30:16,100 --> 01:30:18,200
These three will ignite sequentially...

1109
01:30:18,300 --> 01:30:21,000
...make the fire hotter,
kick up the boiler pressure...

1110
01:30:21,000 --> 01:30:22,400
...and make the train go faster.

1111
01:30:33,800 --> 01:30:34,900
Ready to roll!

1112
01:31:05,800 --> 01:31:06,700
Emmett!

1113
01:31:11,500 --> 01:31:13,200
Marty, are the time circuits on?

1114
01:31:14,900 --> 01:31:15,800
Check!

1115
01:31:16,400 --> 01:31:18,400
Input the destination time:

1116
01:31:18,500 --> 01:31:21,900
October 27, 1985, 11:00 a.m.

1117
01:31:23,400 --> 01:31:27,100
Check. We're cruising
at a steady 25 miles an hour.

1118
01:31:27,800 --> 01:31:29,500
I'm throwing in the Presto Logs.

1119
01:31:38,700 --> 01:31:42,100
The new dashboard gauge
will tell us the boiler temperature.

1120
01:31:42,200 --> 01:31:45,400
It's color-coded to indicate
when each log will fire.

1121
01:31:45,500 --> 01:31:47,300
Green, yellow and red.

1122
01:31:47,800 --> 01:31:51,100
Each detonation will be accompanied
by a sudden burst of acceleration.

1123
01:31:53,200 --> 01:31:57,700
Hopefully we'll hit 88 miles per hour
before the needle gets much past 2,000.

1124
01:31:57,800 --> 01:32:00,200
Why? What happens after it hits 2,000?

1125
01:32:00,600 --> 01:32:02,300
The whole boiler explodes!

1126
01:32:03,600 --> 01:32:04,500
Perfect!

1127
01:32:19,300 --> 01:32:22,100
We just hit 35!
Okay, Marty.

1128
01:32:22,400 --> 01:32:24,400
I'm coming aboard!

1129
01:32:33,700 --> 01:32:34,700
Emmett!

1130
01:32:39,400 --> 01:32:40,600
Come on.

1131
01:32:50,000 --> 01:32:53,300
You better hold onto something!
The yellow log is about to blow!

1132
01:32:58,100 --> 01:32:59,300
Golly.

1133
01:33:02,500 --> 01:33:03,600
We just passed 40!

1134
01:33:35,800 --> 01:33:36,700
Emmett!

1135
01:33:39,000 --> 01:33:41,800
We just passed 45! Go for it!

1136
01:33:51,700 --> 01:33:52,600
Fifty.

1137
01:34:03,400 --> 01:34:04,300
Emmett!

1138
01:34:04,500 --> 01:34:05,400
Clara!

1139
01:34:06,400 --> 01:34:07,800
I love you!

1140
01:34:09,800 --> 01:34:14,700
What's happening?
It's Clara! She's on the train!

1141
01:34:15,600 --> 01:34:16,900
Clara? Perfect.

1142
01:34:17,600 --> 01:34:20,600
She's in the cab! I'm going back for her!

1143
01:34:21,000 --> 01:34:22,400
The windmill!

1144
01:34:22,600 --> 01:34:25,900
Doc! We're going past 50! You'll never make it!

1145
01:34:28,000 --> 01:34:31,700
Then we'll have to take her back with us!
Keep calling out the speed!

1146
01:34:32,200 --> 01:34:35,200
Clara, climb out here to me!

1147
01:34:35,600 --> 01:34:38,300
-I don't know if I can!
-You can do it!

1148
01:34:38,700 --> 01:34:40,200
Just don't look down!

1149
01:34:43,900 --> 01:34:45,400
That's it!

1150
01:34:58,600 --> 01:35:00,200
Sixty miles an hour!

1151
01:35:03,400 --> 01:35:06,300
You're doing fine! Nice and steady!

1152
01:35:09,500 --> 01:35:10,900
Come on!

1153
01:35:11,600 --> 01:35:15,500
-Just a little further!
-I can't! I'm scared!

1154
01:35:17,800 --> 01:35:21,400
Seventy!
Keep coming, Clara!

1155
01:35:22,600 --> 01:35:25,400
Come on! You're doing fine!

1156
01:35:27,200 --> 01:35:30,600
Come on! Nice and easy!

1157
01:35:31,500 --> 01:35:34,800
Don't look down! That's it! You're doing fine!

1158
01:35:37,200 --> 01:35:39,500
The red log is about to blow!

1159
01:35:48,600 --> 01:35:49,500
Clara!

1160
01:35:52,300 --> 01:35:53,900
Emmett!

1161
01:36:03,300 --> 01:36:05,200
I'm trying to reach you!

1162
01:36:05,400 --> 01:36:07,200
Clara, hold on!
I can't!

1163
01:36:17,300 --> 01:36:19,400
I'll slip you the Hoverboard!

1164
01:36:26,600 --> 01:36:28,300
Marty, watch out!

1165
01:36:36,000 --> 01:36:37,500
Emmett, help!

1166
01:36:40,200 --> 01:36:41,400
Hold on!

1167
01:36:44,900 --> 01:36:46,700
Ready, Doc?

1168
01:36:47,600 --> 01:36:48,500
Catch it!

1169
01:36:50,200 --> 01:36:51,200
Yes!

1170
01:37:01,900 --> 01:37:02,900
Emmett!

1171
01:37:03,400 --> 01:37:04,400
Clara!

1172
01:39:42,600 --> 01:39:43,700
Well, Doc...

1173
01:39:45,600 --> 01:39:47,000
...it's destroyed.

1174
01:39:49,400 --> 01:39:50,700
Just like you wanted.

1175
01:40:09,400 --> 01:40:11,500
-Hey, butthead, get away...
-Watch it, Biff!

1176
01:40:11,600 --> 01:40:14,300
I didn't mean to scare you.
I didn't recognize you.

1177
01:40:14,400 --> 01:40:18,300
-What the hell are you doing?
-Just putting on the second coat.

1178
01:40:19,900 --> 01:40:21,200
You going cowboy?

1179
01:40:21,300 --> 01:40:24,000
Come on, guys. We'll be late for brunch.

1180
01:40:25,100 --> 01:40:27,800
Dad, they won't hold your reservations all day.

1181
01:40:27,900 --> 01:40:29,200
I can't find my glasses.

1182
01:40:29,300 --> 01:40:32,600
-Have you seen them?
-They're in your suede jacket.

1183
01:40:32,800 --> 01:40:35,400
Marty? What's wrong?
We thought you went to the lake.

1184
01:40:35,400 --> 01:40:38,600
-You wore that to the lake?
-Thank God you guys are back to normal.

1185
01:40:38,600 --> 01:40:41,200
Who are you supposed to be? Clint Eastwood?

1186
01:40:41,600 --> 01:40:44,000
Right. I have to go get Jennifer.

1187
01:40:48,100 --> 01:40:50,600
-I really like that hat.
-Thanks, Biff.

1188
01:41:05,000 --> 01:41:05,900
Jennifer.

1189
01:41:08,400 --> 01:41:09,400
Jen.

1190
01:41:13,600 --> 01:41:14,600
Jennifer.

1191
01:41:37,100 --> 01:41:38,100
Marty.

1192
01:41:39,500 --> 01:41:40,400
Marty!

1193
01:41:42,400 --> 01:41:43,800
I had the worst nightmare.

1194
01:41:50,300 --> 01:41:52,400
That dream I had is so real.

1195
01:41:54,000 --> 01:41:55,300
It was about the future.

1196
01:41:56,300 --> 01:41:57,500
About us.

1197
01:41:58,100 --> 01:41:59,500
And you got fired.

1198
01:42:00,400 --> 01:42:02,700
Wait a minute.
What do you mean, I got fired?

1199
01:42:03,700 --> 01:42:04,500
Hilldale.

1200
01:42:05,900 --> 01:42:07,700
Hilldale! This is where we live.

1201
01:42:09,300 --> 01:42:12,100
I mean, this is where we're going to live.

1202
01:42:13,800 --> 01:42:14,800
Someday.

1203
01:42:17,700 --> 01:42:20,600
It was a dream, wasn't it?

1204
01:42:25,800 --> 01:42:27,200
The big M.

1205
01:42:28,200 --> 01:42:31,200
-How's it hanging, McFly?
-Hey, Needles.

1206
01:42:31,300 --> 01:42:35,200
Nice set of wheels.
Let's see what she can do.

1207
01:42:35,300 --> 01:42:37,800
Next green light.
No, thanks.

1208
01:42:38,700 --> 01:42:41,200
What's the matter? Chicken?

1209
01:42:45,700 --> 01:42:48,300
-Marty, don't.
-Grab hold of something.

1210
01:42:49,200 --> 01:42:51,000
-Come on!
-Get on!

1211
01:42:52,600 --> 01:42:53,900
Yeah, go!

1212
01:43:16,100 --> 01:43:17,700
Did you do that on purpose?

1213
01:43:17,800 --> 01:43:20,500
Yeah. You think I'm stupid enough
to race that asshole?

1214
01:43:25,900 --> 01:43:28,800
Jeez! I would have hit that Rolls-Royce.

1215
01:43:38,300 --> 01:43:39,800
It erased.

1216
01:43:53,200 --> 01:43:55,400
You're right. There's not much left.

1217
01:43:57,700 --> 01:43:59,300
Doc's never coming back.

1218
01:44:13,600 --> 01:44:15,100
I'll sure miss him, Jen.

1219
01:44:27,200 --> 01:44:28,800
What the hell?

1220
01:44:45,200 --> 01:44:47,700
-Doc!
-Marty!

1221
01:44:48,000 --> 01:44:50,300
-Doc!
-Marty!

1222
01:44:50,800 --> 01:44:52,400
It runs on steam!

1223
01:44:57,600 --> 01:45:00,600
Meet the family. Clara, you know.

1224
01:45:00,800 --> 01:45:03,200
-Hi, Marty!
-Ma'am!

1225
01:45:04,400 --> 01:45:05,900
These are our boys:

1226
01:45:07,200 --> 01:45:10,700
Jules and Verne.

1227
01:45:13,700 --> 01:45:16,400
Boys, this is Marty and Jennifer.

1228
01:45:19,500 --> 01:45:23,400
-Doc, I thought I'd never see you again.
-You can't keep a good scientist down.

1229
01:45:23,600 --> 01:45:25,600
I had to come back for Einstein...

1230
01:45:25,700 --> 01:45:28,500
...and I didn't want you to be worried about me.

1231
01:45:29,400 --> 01:45:32,700
I brought you a little souvenir.

1232
01:45:49,200 --> 01:45:50,400
It's great, Doc.

1233
01:45:51,500 --> 01:45:52,700
Thanks.

1234
01:45:54,600 --> 01:45:58,200
Dr. Brown, I brought this note
back from the future...

1235
01:45:58,200 --> 01:46:00,400
...and now it's erased.

1236
01:46:01,000 --> 01:46:02,700
Of course it's erased.

1237
01:46:04,400 --> 01:46:05,700
What does that mean?

1238
01:46:05,800 --> 01:46:09,000
It means your future hasn't been written yet.

1239
01:46:09,400 --> 01:46:11,000
No one's has.

1240
01:46:11,000 --> 01:46:15,900
Your future is whatever you make it.
So make it a good one, both of you.

1241
01:46:19,000 --> 01:46:20,200
We will, Doc!

1242
01:46:20,300 --> 01:46:21,800
Stand back!

1243
01:46:22,100 --> 01:46:24,100
All right, boys, buckle up!

1244
01:46:29,000 --> 01:46:33,800
Where are you going now? Back to the future?

1245
01:46:34,600 --> 01:46:37,300
No. Already been there.

1246
