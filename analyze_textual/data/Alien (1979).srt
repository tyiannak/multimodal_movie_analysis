[ Gasps ]

463
00:48:45,256 --> 00:48:47,632
Sorry.

464

No, not in the corner.
Psst. Have one of these.

465

Just in case.

Kane? Dallas?
[ Screams ]

You okay?
I didn't see it.
Was it in the overhead?

468

What? It was
up there somewhere.
My God.

[ Dallas ]
Cover up the damn thing!
[ Ash ] Wait.

That's alive!

That's a reflex action.

472
00:50:04,126 --> 00:50:06,044
Well, we've gotta
have a look at this.

473

Excuse me.

474
00:50:26,732 --> 00:50:29,484
[ Ash ] Seems dead enough.
[ Ripley ] Well, good.
Let's get rid of it.

475
00:50:31,028 --> 00:50:33,530
Ripley, for God's sake,

476
00:50:33,614 --> 00:50:37,033
this is the first time
that we've encountered
a species like this.

477
00:50:37,117 --> 00:50:39,661
It has to go back.
All sorts of tests
have to be made.

478
00:50:39,745 --> 00:50:42,205
Ash, are you kidding?
This thing bled acid.

479
00:50:42,289 --> 00:50:45,041
Who knows what it's
gonna do when it's dead.

480
00:50:45,125 --> 00:50:48,336
Think it's safe to assume
it isn't a zombie.

481
00:50:48,420 --> 00:50:51,089
Dallas, it has to go back.

482
00:50:51,173 --> 00:50:53,675
Well, I'd soon...

483
00:50:53,759 --> 00:50:56,219
as not burn it at the stake,
but you're the science officer.

484
00:50:56,345 --> 00:50:57,679
It's your decision, Ash.
Dallas.

485
00:50:59,098 --> 00:51:01,391
How come
I've got to change my mind?
The decision's been made.

486
00:51:01,475 --> 00:51:03,893
I'm not trying
to change your mind, Dallas.
I just want you to listen-

487
00:51:03,978 --> 00:51:05,895
Will you listen to-

488

[ Groans ]

489
00:51:08,274 --> 00:51:10,525
Just tell me how
you can leave that kind
of decision to him.

490
00:51:10,609 --> 00:51:12,610
Look, I just run the ship.

491
00:51:12,695 --> 00:51:15,154
Anything that has to do
with the science division,
Ash has the final word.

492
00:51:15,281 --> 00:51:18,575
-How does that happen?
-It happens, my dear, because that's
what the company wants to happen.

493
00:51:18,659 --> 00:51:21,369
Since when is that
standard procedure?

494
00:51:21,453 --> 00:51:24,038
Standard procedure
is to do what the hell
they tell you to do.

495
00:51:24,164 --> 00:51:27,917
What's happening with
the repairs? How's it going?
They're pretty much finished now.

496
00:51:28,002 --> 00:51:29,919
Why the hell
didn't you tell me so?

497
00:51:30,004 --> 00:51:32,589
- Because there's still
some things left to do.
- Like what?

498
00:51:32,673 --> 00:51:35,049
Well, we're blind
on "B" and "C" decks.

499
00:51:35,175 --> 00:51:38,011
The reserve power
system's blown-
That's a bunch of horseshit.

500
00:51:38,137 --> 00:51:41,264
We can take off without that.
Yeah, we can.
You think that's a good idea?

501
00:51:41,348 --> 00:51:44,225
Look, I just wanna get
the hell out of here,
all right?

[ Engines Roaring ]

Dust in the intakes again.
Number two's overheating.

would you, for Christ's sake?

We're hot.

[ Brett ]
Right.

516

[ Parker ]
What I think we should do
is just freeze him.

517

If he's got a disease,
why don't we stop it
where it is?

518
00:53:32,793 --> 00:53:36,421
- He can always get to a doctor
when we get back home.
- Right.

519
00:53:36,505 --> 00:53:40,174
Whenever he says anything,
you say "right," Brett.
You know that?

00:53:40,300 --> 00:53:42,468
Right.

around, says "right."

- Just like a regular parrot.
- Yeah. Shape up.

- Right.

go into quarantine.

Yes, and so will we.

Thrill me,
will you, please?

Well, according
to my calculations,

to and from the planet-

about what it's made of.

Just make damn sure

on the end of it.

thinner than ours.

to find it.

to search for

within a certain distance,
