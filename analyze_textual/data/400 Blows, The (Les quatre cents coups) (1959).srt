21
00:03:13,709 --> 00:03:18,082
This film is dedicated to
the Memory of Andre Bazin

22
00:03:52,249 --> 00:03:53,808
Doinel! Bring me that

23
00:04:01,363 --> 00:04:03,333
Nice! Get in the corner

24
00:04:10,878 --> 00:04:13,576
Just one minute left.
Silence

25
00:04:15,953 --> 00:04:19,756
30 seconds left.
Silence, please

26
00:04:27,940 --> 00:04:29,841
Be ready to pick up the papers

27
00:04:34,349 --> 00:04:35,510
I'll count to three

28
00:04:37,989 --> 00:04:40,515
One, two

29
00:04:42,729 --> 00:04:43,856
three. Collect the papers

30
00:04:52,545 --> 00:04:53,808
Get his, first

31
00:04:56,385 --> 00:04:58,946
Give it to me. Wait a minute.
-What's going on?

32
00:04:59,122 --> 00:05:00,852
He won't give me his paper.
-No exception

33
00:05:03,496 --> 00:05:04,691
Asshole

34
00:05:06,501 --> 00:05:09,529
Do I have everybody's paper?
Class dismissed

35
00:05:11,876 --> 00:05:13,606
Not you

36
00:05:15,315 --> 00:05:17,717
Recess isn't mandatory.
It's a reward

37
00:05:55,079 --> 00:05:59,576
Here poor Antoine Doinel was
unjustifiably punished by Sourpuss

38
00:05:59,753 --> 00:06:03,816
for a pinup fallen from the sky
It will be an eye for an eye

39
00:06:04,761 --> 00:06:07,664
You need a referee maybe

40
00:06:07,833 --> 00:06:10,564
No recess for three days

41
00:06:10,738 --> 00:06:12,502
That will teach you

42
00:06:23,791 --> 00:06:25,920
Hey guys, look at this

43
00:06:27,030 --> 00:06:30,490
What's so interesting over there?

44
00:06:43,356 --> 00:06:45,622
We have a new poet in our class

45
00:06:45,794 --> 00:06:49,357
Only he can't tell an Alexandrine
from a decasyllabic verse

46
00:06:49,533 --> 00:06:51,934
Doinel, you'll conjugate
for tomorrow

47
00:06:52,103 --> 00:06:53,594
go to your seat

48
00:06:56,444 --> 00:06:59,244
in indicative, conditional and
subjunctive tenses the sentence

49
00:06:59,415 --> 00:07:01,008
everyone else recitation books out

50
00:07:04,357 --> 00:07:06,383
I deface the classroom walls

51
00:07:11,234 --> 00:07:13,669
and abuse French verse

52
00:07:16,409 --> 00:07:17,877
The Hare

53
00:07:26,525 --> 00:07:29,894
Now, Doinel, go get some water

54
00:07:30,064 --> 00:07:33,365
and erase those insanities, or I'll
make you lick the wall, my friend

55
00:07:37,376 --> 00:07:41,337
who gave you permission
to change seats, Richer?

56
00:07:51,532 --> 00:07:54,128
In the season when the thickets

57
00:07:58,777 --> 00:08:03,740
Glow with flowers

58
00:08:07,691 --> 00:08:10,218
When the black tip

59
00:08:20,946 --> 00:08:23,678
Of my long ears

60
00:08:24,852 --> 00:08:26,822
Could be seen

61
00:08:29,893 --> 00:08:31,760
Above

62
00:08:35,302 --> 00:08:38,067
The still green rye

63
00:08:43,416 --> 00:08:47,252
From which I nibbled

64
00:08:50,827 --> 00:08:52,295
The tender stems

65
00:08:56,670 --> 00:08:59,105
As I played around

66
00:09:08,054 --> 00:09:09,545
One day that

67
00:09:13,197 --> 00:09:15,462
Unaware

68
00:09:20,775 --> 00:09:22,334
I was there

69
00:09:25,483 --> 00:09:30,480
Fast asleep in my hutch.
Little Margot surprised me

70
00:09:35,699 --> 00:09:38,135
I saw you, Simonet!
-I didn't do anything, Sir

71
00:09:38,303 --> 00:09:43,938
Naturally.
She loved me so

72
00:09:44,680 --> 00:09:46,979
My beautiful mistress

73
00:09:58,002 --> 00:09:59,732
She was tender

74
00:10:00,972 --> 00:10:03,101
And sweet

75
00:10:04,679 --> 00:10:07,547
How she hugged me on her lap

76
00:10:08,318 --> 00:10:10,014
And kissed me

77
00:10:11,557 --> 00:10:15,086
What idiot whistled?
I'm warning you

78
00:10:15,262 --> 00:10:18,028
If no one confesses, you'll
all be sorry. Right, Simonet?

79
00:10:18,201 --> 00:10:21,195
I didn't do it, Sir.
It wasn't me, Sir

80
00:10:21,372 --> 00:10:25,333
Cowards, too! What a class this year

81
00:10:25,512 --> 00:10:28,540
I've known idiots, but at least
they were discreet

82
00:10:28,717 --> 00:10:33,020
and didn't get caught. And you

83
00:10:33,191 --> 00:10:37,527
you call this clean? You made that
wall dirtier! Go back to your seat

84
00:10:37,699 --> 00:10:41,432
Your parents will hear from me!
Poor France! What a future

85
00:10:50,385 --> 00:10:53,686
Everybody steals money from their
parents! -Maybe but it isn't easy

86
00:10:53,857 --> 00:10:58,229
I bet even Mauricet does it. -Come
here. We want to ask you something

87
00:10:58,398 --> 00:11:01,096
Where'd you get these expensive
glasses? -I bought them

88
00:11:01,270 --> 00:11:03,705
Did you steal the money
from your dad or your mom?

89
00:11:04,808 --> 00:11:08,177
Don't pretend you've never
gone through their pockets

90
00:11:08,347 --> 00:11:11,785
You're the louse
who got me in trouble

91
00:11:12,454 --> 00:11:16,017
You're a louse, Mauricet!
Your days are numbered

92
00:11:16,193 --> 00:11:17,889
You better watch it

93
00:11:20,600 --> 00:11:22,627
I'll never finish tonight

94
00:11:32,820 --> 00:11:35,882
Sourpuss is an asshole.
-It's his job

95
00:11:36,092 --> 00:11:38,288
Before the Army gets me

96
00:11:38,462 --> 00:11:40,830
I'll break his face

97
00:11:41,867 --> 00:11:43,335
Bye.
-Bye

98
00:13:47,669 --> 00:13:50,469
I deface the classroom walls

99
00:14:04,829 --> 00:14:07,095
Hi, Mom.
-Hello

100
00:14:15,214 --> 00:14:18,013
Where's the flour?
-The flour?

101
00:14:18,319 --> 00:14:20,652
What's this? You didn't buy
what I told you to

102
00:14:22,024 --> 00:14:23,583
Where's the list I left you?

103
00:14:24,561 --> 00:14:27,691
I lost it. -No wonder you
get such bad grades

104
00:14:27,866 --> 00:14:29,232
Get me my slippers

105
00:14:32,074 --> 00:14:34,806
In the bedroom.
Under the bed

106
00:14:41,288 --> 00:14:44,282
And go get that flour.
I need it right away

107
00:15:03,958 --> 00:15:08,125
A difficult delivery. They used
forceps. It runs in the family

108
00:15:08,299 --> 00:15:10,996
The same thing happened to her
mother. -It doesn't mean anything

109
00:15:11,169 --> 00:15:15,438
For Fanny, it was over in ten
minutes. But with my last one

110
00:15:15,610 --> 00:15:19,572
if I hadn't had a C-section,
I wouldn't be here, talking to you

111
00:15:19,750 --> 00:15:22,880
And my sister, one every year.
Can you imagine?

112
00:15:23,056 --> 00:15:30,990
The doctor warned her. She had to
have surgery. There was blood over

113
00:15:34,139 --> 00:15:37,542
Always running, son?
-I got in trouble with Mom

114
00:15:37,713 --> 00:15:41,845
You know you shouldn't
get your mother angry

115
00:15:43,402 --> 00:15:47,864
What's that? -A fog-light. I'll
try it on Sunday at the race

116
00:15:59,226 --> 00:16:03,392
Look at your son. All floured up!
-I'm not in the mood

117
00:16:03,566 --> 00:16:05,432
Too bad. I am

118
00:16:07,707 --> 00:16:10,233
What about my change?
-I need it for lunch at school

119
00:16:10,410 --> 00:16:11,776
Ask your father

120
00:16:17,922 --> 00:16:21,860
Nothing quiet on the home front.
-I need some money for lunch, Dad

121
00:16:22,029 --> 00:16:26,593
Only 1.000 francs.
-Therefore you hope for 500

122
00:16:26,769 --> 00:16:29,399
therefore you need 300.
Here's 100

123
00:16:30,742 --> 00:16:34,545
Here's 500 more.
Next time ask your mother

124
00:16:34,715 --> 00:16:38,744
Where are the scissors?
-Where are the scissors?

125
00:16:38,921 --> 00:16:43,087
That's not funny.
Put that homework away,

126
00:16:43,261 --> 00:16:47,200
it's time to eat.
-Your mother's right. There's a time

127
00:16:47,368 --> 00:16:49,064
and place for everything

128
00:16:51,074 --> 00:16:54,705
Where did you get this pen?
-I traded it

129
00:16:55,647 --> 00:16:57,548
You do a lot of trading lately

130
00:17:03,460 --> 00:17:05,861
Do you smell something?

131
00:17:07,332 --> 00:17:09,494
It's the fish.
-It's promising

132
00:17:11,072 --> 00:17:15,978
I can't wait. Go ask your mom
if the dishtowel is burning. -Why?

133
00:17:17,347 --> 00:17:18,610
That's a joke

134
00:17:35,910 --> 00:17:38,311
You can clear the table now

135
00:17:38,481 --> 00:17:42,716
I got a call from your cousin.
His wife is pregnant again

136
00:17:42,888 --> 00:17:46,826
Four times in 3 years! Worse
than rabbits! That's disgusting

137
00:17:46,994 --> 00:17:50,090
By the way, what should
we do with the kid next summer?

138
00:17:50,199 --> 00:17:53,637
There's always camp.
-You're right and it's fun

139
00:17:53,805 --> 00:17:57,038
We don't have to decide yet.
-The sooner the better

140
00:17:59,847 --> 00:18:02,043
Hey, be careful

141
00:18:03,920 --> 00:18:06,049
Isn't it a beauty?
-Lions Racing Club

142
00:18:06,892 --> 00:18:09,361
What's going on here?
-Slowly

143
00:18:10,597 --> 00:18:14,365
Where would you prefer
to race, next Sunday?

144
00:18:14,537 --> 00:18:17,030
It's my pick this time.
-I want to rest on Sunday

145
00:18:18,677 --> 00:18:22,877
I'll go over to Huguette's.
-What will the fellows think?

146
00:18:23,050 --> 00:18:25,542
Listen, I need a rest.
Between the cleaning

147
00:18:25,721 --> 00:18:29,250
in the morning.
-And in the afternoon

148
00:18:29,427 --> 00:18:32,591
Your typing in the afternoon. You
definitely got the touch! -Go to bed

149
00:18:35,703 --> 00:18:37,228
'Night Dad, 'night Mom

150
00:18:37,573 --> 00:18:40,100
You are so stupid

151
00:18:40,277 --> 00:18:45,843
Can't you take a joke? -You're
wasting your time with this crap

152
00:18:46,019 --> 00:18:48,956
Antoine, don't forget the garbage
and turn your light off

153
00:18:49,124 --> 00:18:53,153
I'm making contacts. It could
help me get a promotion

154
00:18:54,131 --> 00:18:56,829
You? You'll never be
VP of anything

155
00:19:42,206 --> 00:19:44,904
Get up, get up,
we didn't hear the alarm

156
00:20:02,572 --> 00:20:05,838
I deface the classroom walls

157
00:20:09,750 --> 00:20:13,381
I have no socks left around these
holes! -Those are gone

158
00:20:13,556 --> 00:20:15,923
Buy yourself some new ones.
The others are dirty

159
00:20:17,428 --> 00:20:21,059
I gave you money for the kid's
new sheets, remember?

160
00:20:21,234 --> 00:20:24,433
He prefers his sleeping bag

161
00:20:24,606 --> 00:20:28,738
Don't you, sweetheart?
-At least, it keeps me warm

162
00:20:28,912 --> 00:20:30,380
You're still here?

163
00:20:38,160 --> 00:20:41,495
Why are you running?
-We're going to be late

164
00:20:41,665 --> 00:20:45,434
We'll have to sneak in again and
we'll get in trouble. -Don't rush

165
00:20:45,606 --> 00:20:49,100
Why?
-Sourpuss won't let you in

166
00:20:50,279 --> 00:20:53,478
You think he'll do it? -Yes.
He can't stand you. You got money?

167
00:20:53,651 --> 00:20:56,884
Sure. Lunch money.
-In that case, let's go

168
00:20:57,090 --> 00:20:58,683
What's the plan?

169
00:21:20,927 --> 00:21:25,367
Follow me. Put your bag
next to mine behind the door.

170
00:21:25,534 --> 00:21:27,969
Will they be safe?
-I always leave mine here

171
00:25:14,624 --> 00:25:17,856
Oh, my God. It's Antoine. I'm sure
he saw me. -Which one is your son?

172
00:25:18,030 --> 00:25:21,159
The brown one.
He's supposed to be in school

173
00:25:21,334 --> 00:25:24,305
You're going to get it tonight!
-Kidding? She won't tell my father

174
00:25:24,473 --> 00:25:26,635
That wasn't him?
-Never saw him before

175
00:25:26,809 --> 00:25:28,402
You're safe, then

176
00:25:56,389 --> 00:25:58,415
I'll go back to school tomorrow

177
00:25:58,592 --> 00:26:02,086
But I'll need an excuse note.
What about you?

178
00:26:02,265 --> 00:26:04,359
I have an old letter from my folks
I never used

179
00:26:05,336 --> 00:26:08,933
I'll cut off the date.
Here, you can copy it tonight

180
00:26:09,109 --> 00:26:12,512
But the handwriting?
-Imitate your mother's

181
00:26:12,681 --> 00:26:15,675
It'll be hard, she writes funny

182
00:26:15,479 --> 00:26:18,678
Don't worry. It will work!
-I hope so

183
00:26:22,023 --> 00:26:23,491
Dear Sir

184
00:26:27,532 --> 00:26:35,774
Will you excuse my son

185
00:26:37,448 --> 00:26:38,780
Rene

186
00:26:40,687 --> 00:26:44,387
who was sick

187
00:26:45,261 --> 00:26:46,729
My son Rene

188
00:27:09,067 --> 00:27:12,664
Something's burning again here?
-It comes from downstairs

189
00:27:12,840 --> 00:27:16,300
Set the table for two only.
-Why? Has Mom left?

190
00:27:16,480 --> 00:27:19,576
No, she called to say
she'd be home late

191
00:27:19,752 --> 00:27:22,085
Her boss needs her for the inventory

192
00:27:24,159 --> 00:27:27,562
So we'll cook ourselves and
have a real bachelor's dinner

193
00:27:28,465 --> 00:27:31,995
She said there are eggs.
-I know where

194
00:27:38,516 --> 00:27:40,075
How was school today?

195
00:27:41,654 --> 00:27:44,489
What did you study?
-The Hare

196
00:27:44,659 --> 00:27:49,190
Oh, yes. The Hare and The Tortoise.
-No, it's just The Hare

197
00:27:50,636 --> 00:27:53,505
Did you do well?
-I wasn't asked anything

198
00:27:53,674 --> 00:27:56,509
You must be aggressive
to go forward in life

199
00:27:56,679 --> 00:27:59,376
or else you won't make it
to the finish line

200
00:27:59,551 --> 00:28:01,520
You have to take initiatives

201
00:28:02,856 --> 00:28:07,887
Have you thought about your mother's
birthday? It's on the 17th, you know

202
00:28:08,064 --> 00:28:10,226
I hope you'll get her something

203
00:28:12,038 --> 00:28:13,631
Antoine, are you listening?

204
00:28:15,276 --> 00:28:16,938
Oh, I know what you're thinking

205
00:28:17,880 --> 00:28:20,350
She's been tough on you lately

206
00:28:20,518 --> 00:28:24,753
She's nervous.
You have to understand

207
00:28:26,194 --> 00:28:29,859
She has lots to do between
being a housewife and her job

208
00:28:30,033 --> 00:28:31,935
And this place is too small

209
00:28:33,038 --> 00:28:35,838
We might be moving soon.
I'm working on it

210
00:28:40,251 --> 00:28:42,778
And you see, at the office

211
00:28:42,955 --> 00:28:45,926
they take advantage of women

212
00:28:47,396 --> 00:28:49,558
But she loves you, you know.
She does. Oh, shit

213
00:29:02,120 --> 00:29:04,784
Where did you put my Michelin guide?
-I didn't touch it

214
00:29:04,958 --> 00:29:07,554
Antoine, you know,
I can't stand it when you lie

215
00:29:08,664 --> 00:29:11,692
I'm sure.
-I'm sure I had it yesterday

216
00:29:13,071 --> 00:29:15,439
I swear it's not me!
-It's incredible

217
00:29:15,609 --> 00:29:17,339
how things always disappear
in this house

218
00:29:19,048 --> 00:29:20,448
I didn't take it

219
00:29:24,189 --> 00:29:26,125
All right, I'll ask your mother

220
00:29:30,701 --> 00:29:32,329
Go to bed

221
00:29:34,006 --> 00:29:35,531
Don't forget the garbage

222
00:30:32,703 --> 00:30:34,035
My boss drove me home

223
00:30:35,174 --> 00:30:38,407
I couldn't refuse

224
00:30:38,579 --> 00:30:41,641
Are you getting paid overtime?
-Of course, at the end of the month

225
00:30:41,818 --> 00:30:44,151
He should give you cash

226
00:30:44,322 --> 00:30:48,351
Enough already! -No wonder
you'll need to rest on Sunday

227
00:30:48,528 --> 00:30:52,627
Where's my Michelin's guide?
-How would I know? Ask Antoine

228
00:30:52,802 --> 00:30:55,329
He said he didn't touch it.
-He's always lying.

229
00:30:55,507 --> 00:30:57,533
Like you. -You should show him
some manners

230
00:30:57,710 --> 00:31:04,348
I gave him a name. I feed him.
-I'm sick of this

231
00:31:04,522 --> 00:31:08,085
If you can't handle him, let's
send him away to boarding school

232
00:31:08,261 --> 00:31:09,820
so I can have some
peace for a change

233
00:31:28,996 --> 00:31:31,591
The best thing is to eat out
until the end of the month

234
00:31:31,766 --> 00:31:34,259
For that, I need a clean shirt

235
00:31:34,438 --> 00:31:37,068
You could at least wash the collar

236
00:31:37,242 --> 00:31:40,213
If only you hadn't bought
that fog-light

237
00:31:40,381 --> 00:31:41,781
I got it secondhand

238
00:31:48,394 --> 00:31:52,925
Well? Open the door!
-What if it's the gas man?

239
00:31:53,102 --> 00:31:54,934
They always send a notice first

240
00:32:00,914 --> 00:32:04,181
Hi, Sir. I'm in Antoine's class.
I came to see if he is better

241
00:32:04,353 --> 00:32:07,917
Better? Why?
-He wasn't at school yesterday

242
00:32:09,129 --> 00:32:10,391
Did you hear that?

243
00:32:12,601 --> 00:32:14,900
Thanks, kiddo.
-Bye, Sir

244
00:32:22,116 --> 00:32:23,641
You don't seem surprised

245
00:32:24,554 --> 00:32:27,855
Why should I be?
I expect anything from him

246
00:32:32,132 --> 00:32:34,932
What excuse should I use?
-Something big

247
00:32:35,104 --> 00:32:38,200
The bigger, the better. Last year,
when my mom broke her leg

248
00:32:38,377 --> 00:32:41,074
I told them everything,
except that she was drunk

249
00:32:41,247 --> 00:32:45,118
I didn't need a letter.
-I can't tell a thing like that

250
00:32:45,288 --> 00:32:49,125
In any case, we can't show up
together. -Right. You go first

251
00:33:14,402 --> 00:33:15,768
So, there you are

252
00:33:16,672 --> 00:33:19,541
A little extra homework
and you get sick

253
00:33:19,711 --> 00:33:24,117
And your parents fell for it. What
excuse do you have this time?

254
00:33:25,087 --> 00:33:26,487
Let's see the letter

255
00:33:26,656 --> 00:33:30,424
I don't have one. -And you think
you're going to get away with this?

256
00:33:30,595 --> 00:33:31,995
It would be too easy, my friend

257
00:33:33,868 --> 00:33:38,102
But Sir, it's my mother.
-What about your mother?

258
00:33:38,275 --> 00:33:39,436
She's dead

259
00:33:40,038 --> 00:33:44,375
I'm sorry, kid. I didn't know

260
00:33:45,581 --> 00:33:47,140
Was she ill?
-Yes, Sir

261
00:33:48,986 --> 00:33:52,550
You should have told me. You should
always confide in your teachers

262
00:33:54,028 --> 00:33:55,929
Go join the others

263
00:34:07,251 --> 00:34:09,881
What did you tell him?
-Leave me alone

264
00:34:21,909 --> 00:34:24,846
Better thorns in the woods than...
-Up your

265
00:34:25,482 --> 00:34:29,443
If you washed your ears, Duverger,
you would hear the whispering

266
00:34:29,622 --> 00:34:33,355
Than up your ass! -He's not
whispering. He wants to confuse me

267
00:34:35,465 --> 00:34:37,229
I'm all mixed up now, Sir

268
00:34:39,138 --> 00:34:43,601
Than flowers in the cradle. -Flowers
in the cradle. Better to have freedom

269
00:34:44,981 --> 00:34:48,420
And feel a threat...
-Than slavery

270
00:34:52,828 --> 00:34:55,890
With an eternal April...
And you're eternally lazy

271
00:34:56,067 --> 00:34:58,093
Sit down! F!
-I knew it at home

272
00:34:59,072 --> 00:35:02,202
Doinel! Oh, sorry, my boy

273
00:35:02,377 --> 00:35:03,709
Simonot

274
00:35:49,891 --> 00:35:52,794
I suggest he gets
maximum punishment

275
00:35:52,964 --> 00:35:56,697
He's beyond that.
He was out of line

276
00:35:56,869 --> 00:36:00,399
This is a matter for his parents.
-We'll settle this at home tonight

277
00:36:08,657 --> 00:36:12,390
What're you gonna do?
-After that

278
00:36:12,563 --> 00:36:16,434
I can't live with my parents
anymore. I have to go away

279
00:36:16,603 --> 00:36:20,508
You're over reacting!
-Well

280
00:36:20,677 --> 00:36:24,376
I've got to live my own life.
I'll write them a letter and explain

281
00:36:24,550 --> 00:36:26,815
Right now?
-Yes, I better

282
00:36:26,987 --> 00:36:30,721
Where will you sleep tonight?
-I don't know. I don't care

283
00:36:30,894 --> 00:36:34,024
I might have an idea.
Meet me in an hour

284
00:36:34,199 --> 00:36:36,294
in front of the fountain,
place Pigalle. -OK

285
00:36:59,576 --> 00:37:01,842
It used to be my
uncle's printing factory

286
00:37:02,014 --> 00:37:04,780
The machines were so heavy,
the floor caved in

287
00:37:04,952 --> 00:37:06,477
Do you think it's dangerous?

288
00:37:11,162 --> 00:37:14,292
No. It already hit the bottom!
At least you'll be warm here

289
00:37:27,490 --> 00:37:30,393
Here's a mattress and a pillow

290
00:37:32,499 --> 00:37:34,297
Wow, it's heavy

291
00:37:36,873 --> 00:37:38,671
Don't come here until midnight

292
00:37:42,115 --> 00:37:44,778
Keep my bag. You'll give it
back to me tomorrow

293
00:37:49,861 --> 00:37:52,525
My dear Parents. I understand,
misspelled of course

294
00:37:52,699 --> 00:37:55,101
the gravity of my lie.
-Listen to this

295
00:37:55,271 --> 00:37:58,674
Why did he have me die and not you?
-He prefers me, obviously

296
00:37:58,843 --> 00:38:01,313
But now, we can't
live together anymore

297
00:38:01,481 --> 00:38:04,920
So I'm going to try to live
my own life here or elsewhere

298
00:38:05,087 --> 00:38:08,081
When I'm a man, I'll return

299
00:38:08,259 --> 00:38:12,665
and we'll talk about everything.
Goodbye. Love, Antoine

300
00:38:12,833 --> 00:38:15,099
So, you think it's normal
that he hates me

301
00:38:15,271 --> 00:38:18,470
You're too hard on him.
-He gets on my nerves

302
00:38:41,382 --> 00:38:43,408
Can you help me catch him?

303
00:38:46,725 --> 00:38:49,787
That's your sister? -I don't know
her. She asked me to chase her dog

304
00:38:49,963 --> 00:38:52,091
Is it her dog?
-I don't know

305
00:38:56,340 --> 00:38:59,506
May I help you?
-Sure. The more the better

306
00:38:59,680 --> 00:39:01,444
What's his name?
-I don't know

307
00:39:03,854 --> 00:39:07,587
Beat it, kid!
-But she asked me first

308
00:39:12,167 --> 00:39:14,899
MERRY CHRISTMAS

309
00:42:15,244 --> 00:42:18,443
Tell me, Doinel, I bet
you got it last night

310
00:42:18,617 --> 00:42:20,416
Not at all, everything went fine

311
00:42:23,592 --> 00:42:25,185
Parents are irresponsible

312
00:42:33,909 --> 00:42:37,176
Last and simple question

313
00:42:48,634 --> 00:42:50,398
No, the tip of the tongue
between the teeth

314
00:42:51,172 --> 00:42:52,606
As if you had a lisp

315
00:42:55,946 --> 00:42:59,111
But I can't, Sir. Not everybody
has a tongue like yours

316
00:42:59,753 --> 00:43:00,914
Shut up

317
00:43:01,222 --> 00:43:04,625
Go, sit...
Go sit down

318
00:43:06,432 --> 00:43:07,798
You're insolent

319
00:43:44,529 --> 00:43:46,999
Fronchot, you're in charge
until I come back

320
00:43:54,246 --> 00:43:57,308
We don't know what
to do with him anymore

321
00:43:57,484 --> 00:44:00,284
My dear Lady, you don't deserve this

322
00:44:00,456 --> 00:44:04,452
My poor darling. Are you alright?

323
00:44:04,630 --> 00:44:06,657
Where did you spend the night?
-In a printing factory

324
00:44:08,703 --> 00:44:11,970
I don't care about his grades.
All I want is for him to behave

325
00:44:12,142 --> 00:44:13,303
Alright then

326
00:44:14,146 --> 00:44:18,107
Maybe it's genetic

327
00:44:34,395 --> 00:44:36,227
You mustn't catch cold

328
00:44:37,900 --> 00:44:39,927
Now jump in bed

329
00:44:41,273 --> 00:44:42,536
I'm not tired, Mom

330
00:44:44,545 --> 00:44:47,038
No, no. You'll be more
comfortable in ours

331
00:44:58,536 --> 00:45:01,473
You know, I was once
your age too

332
00:45:01,641 --> 00:45:03,576
Children always forget that

333
00:45:03,744 --> 00:45:06,146
I didn't want to confide
to my parents either

334
00:45:06,315 --> 00:45:08,045
I kept a secret diary

335
00:45:08,953 --> 00:45:12,584
One day, I'll show it to you

336
00:45:13,761 --> 00:45:17,996
When I was your age
I ran away with a farm-boy

337
00:45:18,169 --> 00:45:20,639
It wasn't serious
but we were caught

338
00:45:20,806 --> 00:45:23,242
My mother made me promise
never to see him again

339
00:45:23,411 --> 00:45:26,280
and she didn't tell my father.
So, I cried

340
00:45:26,449 --> 00:45:30,183
but I obeyed, because
a mother always knows best

341
00:45:30,356 --> 00:45:32,792
We, too, can have secrets, you know

342
00:45:32,961 --> 00:45:36,865
What did you mean in your letter by

343
00:45:37,034 --> 00:45:41,269
We'll talk about everything.
-I meant

344
00:45:41,442 --> 00:45:45,107
my problems at school.
-So, tell me

345
00:45:45,281 --> 00:45:46,806
I can't concentrate

346
00:45:47,719 --> 00:45:50,189
I'd like to quit school
and start making a living

347
00:45:50,357 --> 00:45:53,692
What are you saying?

348
00:45:53,862 --> 00:45:56,731
I wish I'd studied longer

349
00:45:56,960 --> 00:45:59,726
And if your father
had gone to college

350
00:45:59,898 --> 00:46:01,924
he'd be much further in his career

351
00:46:02,101 --> 00:46:05,198
I know you learn lots
of useless things at school

352
00:46:05,374 --> 00:46:08,072
Algebra, science

353
00:46:08,246 --> 00:46:11,012
Who needs it? But French, eh?

354
00:46:11,184 --> 00:46:14,087
We all need to write letters

355
00:46:15,257 --> 00:46:18,457
Let's share another secret, Ok?

356
00:46:19,831 --> 00:46:24,932
If next time you have a test
you're among

357
00:46:25,140 --> 00:46:28,874
the top five, I'll give
you 1.000 francs, Ok?

358
00:46:29,047 --> 00:46:30,606
But you mustn't tell your father

359
00:48:07,880 --> 00:48:10,475
The dying man pulled himself up

360
00:48:10,650 --> 00:48:14,248
And gave his children
a piercing look

361
00:48:14,423 --> 00:48:17,417
His hair bristled
on the nape of his neck

362
00:48:17,595 --> 00:48:22,001
His eyes lit up. A breath caressed
his face and made it sublime

363
00:48:22,169 --> 00:48:24,401
He raised his hand with anger

364
00:48:24,574 --> 00:48:27,101
And shouted Archimedes'
famous last words

365
00:48:27,279 --> 00:48:29,043
Eureka! I found it

366
00:48:43,339 --> 00:48:47,675
Describe a serious event which you
witnessed and involved you personally

367
00:48:50,050 --> 00:48:51,814
Eureka, I found it

368
00:48:55,826 --> 00:49:01,291
My grandfather's death

369
00:49:29,449 --> 00:49:31,850
The boss is sleeping
with the new secretary now

370
00:49:33,489 --> 00:49:34,923
Well armed that girl

371
00:49:35,760 --> 00:49:38,890
She used her weapons to be
promoted executive secretary

372
00:49:40,634 --> 00:49:42,729
Of course, she's got what it takes

373
00:49:43,739 --> 00:49:47,200
Now, we'll have to watch out for
her. You know, pillow talk

374
00:49:48,180 --> 00:49:50,412
I used to tell

375
00:49:50,584 --> 00:49:52,850
how to cheat on her travel expenses

376
00:49:53,022 --> 00:49:54,923
but now I may regret it

377
00:49:56,628 --> 00:50:00,362
By the way, I still haven't
found my Michelin guide

378
00:50:01,436 --> 00:50:05,808
One of you must have it.
-Who cares?

379
00:50:05,976 --> 00:50:07,467
Well, I don't like mysteries

380
00:50:08,715 --> 00:50:12,210
You left something on the stove
again. -No, I didn't

381
00:50:16,795 --> 00:50:18,525
I can't believe this.
Stop screaming

382
00:50:19,232 --> 00:50:20,861
Go get some water instead of
screaming

383
00:50:23,831 --> 00:50:26,199
You idiot! I've had it with you

384
00:50:26,370 --> 00:50:30,401
What possessed you,
to light a candle in there?

385
00:50:30,578 --> 00:50:35,212
It was for Balzac, Daddy. -Balzac?
Are you pulling my leg?

386
00:50:35,388 --> 00:50:38,588
It was for my writing class. -Leave
him alone. He promised me something

387
00:50:38,794 --> 00:50:43,429
To collect our home insurance?
One candle won't do the job

388
00:50:43,604 --> 00:50:46,074
You want my lighter, perhaps.
-Don't be ridiculous

389
00:50:47,111 --> 00:50:50,380
As long as we feed you,
you'll do as you're told

390
00:50:50,919 --> 00:50:53,516
or else we'll send you
to the military Academy

391
00:50:53,658 --> 00:50:58,532
You never heard of it. You'll learn
fast! They'll keep you in the line

392
00:50:58,701 --> 00:51:02,232
Why don't we get out of here

393
00:51:02,409 --> 00:51:05,540
and go to the movies together?
-Good

394
00:51:05,715 --> 00:51:08,710
That's your way of
teaching him a lesson?

395
00:51:08,888 --> 00:51:12,225
Did you write a good paper?
-I think so

396
00:51:15,902 --> 00:51:19,934
Trust him, Julien.
You'll have a pleasant surprise

397
00:51:20,111 --> 00:51:22,877
Sounds dangerous. -So, are you
taking us to the movies?

398
00:51:23,050 --> 00:51:25,452
What's playing?
-Paris is Ours

399
00:51:25,621 --> 00:51:28,650
Since you're both against me.
-You'd rather stay here?

400
00:51:28,828 --> 00:51:37,211
I deserve to go out! But they don't
care much for arsonists at the theater

401
00:52:08,942 --> 00:52:15,946
She had one of those...
-That's all you noticed

402
00:52:20,966 --> 00:52:24,963
I liked the movie.
-But it wasn't funny

403
00:52:25,141 --> 00:52:29,606
But it had some depth.
-Some what?

404
00:52:47,051 --> 00:52:50,991
Gen. Daredevil and his Army

405
00:52:53,965 --> 00:52:56,801
Look at your mother's legs.
Pretty, eh?

406
00:53:07,393 --> 00:53:12,859
Home sweet home, smoky though.
-Don't forget the garbage, honey

407
00:53:13,939 --> 00:53:17,504
I've won him over.
I hope I won't regret it

408
00:54:07,012 --> 00:54:11,510
Doinel, if your paper is first today
it's because I've decided to give

409
00:54:11,689 --> 00:54:14,524
the results beginning with the worst

410
00:54:14,695 --> 00:54:18,760
Your search for perfection
led you straight to an F, my friend

411
00:54:18,936 --> 00:54:23,708
To those less familiar with Balzac,
we have here A Sinister Affair

412
00:54:24,748 --> 00:54:30,818
That Doinel chose to write about his
grandfather's death was his right

413
00:54:30,993 --> 00:54:35,662
We know he doesn't hesitate to
sacrifice his relatives if necessary

414
00:54:35,837 --> 00:54:38,638
It's not true, Sir. I didn't cheat!
-Judge for yourselves

415
00:54:40,212 --> 00:54:45,554
The dying man pulled himself up, and
gave his children a piercing look

416
00:54:45,723 --> 00:54:49,356
His hair bristled
on the nape of his neck

417
00:54:49,531 --> 00:54:52,526
His eyes lit up. A breath caressed
his face and made it sublime

418
00:54:52,704 --> 00:54:56,542
He raised his hand with anger and
shouted Archimedes' famous last words

419
00:54:56,712 --> 00:55:00,173
Eureka! I found it!
Well, I found it, too, Doinel

420
00:55:00,353 --> 00:55:03,382
You're an abominable plagiarist!
-That's not true

421
00:55:03,559 --> 00:55:05,495
Take your paper to
the principal, immediately

422
00:55:10,306 --> 00:55:12,572
And tell him you're suspended from
class until the end of the semester

423
00:55:28,075 --> 00:55:30,568
He didn't cheat, Sir. I sat next to
him. I would have noticed if he did

424
00:55:30,746 --> 00:55:33,650
You want to be suspended, too?
-I wouldn't mind

425
00:55:34,921 --> 00:55:37,916
Talking back? Get out

426
00:55:38,195 --> 00:55:41,690
I don't mind being suspended but
I don't want to go out. -Get out

427
00:55:41,869 --> 00:55:45,741
It's illegal! -I'll show
you who makes the law here

428
00:55:57,767 --> 00:56:00,762
So, did you take him to the
principal? -No, he ran away

429
00:56:08,990 --> 00:56:13,090
So I punched him
and I ran away

430
00:56:13,265 --> 00:56:17,103
What happened? -He was furious. I'm
suspended from school until Christmas

431
00:56:23,252 --> 00:56:26,588
Now I really can't go home

432
00:56:26,759 --> 00:56:30,357
My father said he'd send me to the
Military Academy. -What's that?

433
00:56:30,533 --> 00:56:33,437
Some kind of military school.
-You'll wear a nice uniform

434
00:56:33,607 --> 00:56:37,171
and besides, there's a future in the
Army. -Thanks, but no, thanks

435
00:56:37,347 --> 00:56:41,789
If only it was the Navy!
I've never seen the sea

436
00:56:41,956 --> 00:56:45,360
I've seen the Channel, the Atlantic,
the Mediterranean

437
00:56:45,530 --> 00:56:49,766
but not the North Sea. Come on,
you can stay with me. We'll manage

438
00:57:17,026 --> 00:57:19,497
Holy cow, a horse

439
00:57:20,300 --> 00:57:21,996
It's my father's. It's a souvenir

440
00:57:24,107 --> 00:57:26,169
It's big here

441
00:57:27,948 --> 00:57:32,583
You can sleep on the couch. No one
will know. -What about your folks?

442
00:57:32,758 --> 00:57:35,889
They're never here. My mother drinks
and my father is always at the track

443
00:57:36,064 --> 00:57:37,465
You're free to come and go

444
00:57:38,870 --> 00:57:42,139
First, we've got to find a way
to make some money

445
00:57:43,011 --> 00:57:46,746
Right, that's the first thing to do.
-That's the first thing to do

446
00:57:46,919 --> 00:57:49,618
In the meantime, I'll take an
advance on my inheritance

447
01:00:07,268 --> 01:00:10,468
Hi, Lady!
-Little wretch

448
01:00:38,397 --> 01:00:41,665
Have you seen your mother lately?
-Today when I came home from school

449
01:00:43,942 --> 01:00:47,210
She makes sure she's out
when I'm here

450
01:00:47,381 --> 01:00:49,044
She must be up to something

451
01:00:51,549 --> 01:00:52,778
Where's the fruit?

452
01:01:16,331 --> 01:01:17,732
This is for you

453
01:01:42,149 --> 01:01:44,984
Oh, 9:30. I'll be late for the club

454
01:02:03,557 --> 01:02:05,653
Hurry up! We'll miss the newsreel

455
01:02:55,493 --> 01:02:56,985
Boy, I'm thirsty

456
01:03:01,238 --> 01:03:04,642
It's already empty, asshole.
-Your turn. Hurry up

457
01:03:17,002 --> 01:03:19,974
Eh, that's the old man!
-Help me with the blanket

458
01:03:33,268 --> 01:03:36,172
That's fine.
What's all this smoke?

459
01:03:36,341 --> 01:03:38,573
Where do you think you are?

460
01:03:38,746 --> 01:03:41,649
Alright, retain the cost of
3 cigars on your pocket-money

461
01:03:41,819 --> 01:03:44,791
What's this?
My horse is not a coat rack

462
01:03:47,263 --> 01:03:50,964
It's worth a lot of money!
It's a work of art

463
01:03:51,604 --> 01:03:53,904
I'll never get rid of it,
unless I have to

464
01:03:55,112 --> 01:03:58,881
Turn your light off,
and go to bed now

465
01:04:08,805 --> 01:04:10,034
Eh, not bad

466
01:04:19,760 --> 01:04:23,358
Give me your Michelin guide.
-We could sell the horse

467
01:04:23,534 --> 01:04:26,165
No. My dad would kill me

468
01:04:26,340 --> 01:04:29,141
Coward! With the money
we'd live by the sea

469
01:04:29,312 --> 01:04:32,045
have boats. We'd be on our own

470
01:05:30,500 --> 01:05:33,495
Make up your mind. -I'm sure we
could get one from my father's office

471
01:05:33,673 --> 01:05:37,238
Let's get it, then. -But we couldn't
sell it. They're all numbered

472
01:05:37,414 --> 01:05:41,684
We'll pawn it.
My mother pawns everything

473
01:09:17,215 --> 01:09:18,740
How much?
-10 percent

474
01:09:19,553 --> 01:09:22,184
and 1000 francs in advance. -No,
when you get back with the money

475
01:09:22,358 --> 01:09:24,351
I see you don't trust me

476
01:09:58,630 --> 01:10:02,695
We want it back.
-Where do you think you're going?

477
01:10:02,871 --> 01:10:03,965
I thought you were gone

478
01:10:05,410 --> 01:10:08,746
It didn't work. They want to see a
a receipt. -Give it back to us then

479
01:10:08,916 --> 01:10:11,615
Fine, but I want
500 francs for my trouble

480
01:10:11,789 --> 01:10:14,522
We don't have any money.
-Well

481
01:10:14,695 --> 01:10:18,499
then 300. -We're broke.
Give us back our typewriter

482
01:10:18,670 --> 01:10:22,165
Then I'll keep the typewriter
as a down payment

483
01:10:22,276 --> 01:10:24,645
No way! It's ours!
-Listen

484
01:10:24,815 --> 01:10:27,651
Give it back or I'll break
your face. -Hands off

485
01:10:27,821 --> 01:10:30,987
It's no more yours than mine,
alright? There comes a cop

486
01:10:31,161 --> 01:10:32,528
Let's ask him

487
01:10:34,868 --> 01:10:37,100
O.K. Keep the damned thing

488
01:10:42,483 --> 01:10:45,046
I'm sick of carrying it!
-It's your turn

489
01:10:45,222 --> 01:10:48,422
My father will guess I took it.
-It was your idea

490
01:10:48,595 --> 01:10:51,761
It was yours, asshole.
-I don't care. I'll leave it here

491
01:10:51,935 --> 01:10:56,707
Are you nuts?
-Alright, I'll take it back then

492
01:10:56,878 --> 01:10:59,816
but I'm going to wear a hat

493
01:10:59,984 --> 01:11:01,283
so the concierge won't recognize me

494
01:11:03,090 --> 01:11:07,293
Please, bring it back for me.
-Oh, no! It wasn't my idea

495
01:11:07,466 --> 01:11:11,166
OK. But you're an asshole.
Hold it, while I put on the hat

496
01:11:11,340 --> 01:11:12,741
You'll wait for me outside

497
01:11:48,781 --> 01:11:52,585
You're Mr. Doinel's son!
Put that down

498
01:11:52,755 --> 01:11:55,488
Your father's not going to like this

499
01:11:55,661 --> 01:11:59,999
This time, I'll show them
I'm doing my job

500
01:12:00,170 --> 01:12:03,233
Don't try to escape.
I'm warning you

501
01:12:03,409 --> 01:12:06,210
I've dealt with punks like you before

502
01:12:08,152 --> 01:12:11,990
Mr. Doinel? Sorry to bother you

503
01:12:12,160 --> 01:12:15,257
but you better come over

504
01:12:17,237 --> 01:12:20,835
Let's say it's a surprise.
But not a pleasant one

505
01:12:24,055 --> 01:12:25,547
Keep that hat on

506
01:12:31,438 --> 01:12:34,069
I'm not taking you to
a party, this time

507
01:12:34,244 --> 01:12:37,547
Happy days are over for you. Your
mother and I will have some peace

508
01:12:37,718 --> 01:12:40,417
Take a good look at your pal

509
01:12:41,560 --> 01:12:43,359
because you won't be
seeing him for a while

510
01:12:59,164 --> 01:13:03,037
Maybe this will do it.
This can't go on anymore

511
01:13:03,207 --> 01:13:05,678
If I'd done this when I was your age,
my father would have killed me

512
01:13:09,019 --> 01:13:10,454
Can we see the Chief?

513
01:13:15,667 --> 01:13:20,132
We've tried everything. Kindness,
persuasion, punishment

514
01:13:20,310 --> 01:13:24,274
But we never hit him.
-Sometimes, the old methods

515
01:13:24,453 --> 01:13:27,483
Of course, but we're not like that

516
01:13:28,762 --> 01:13:31,325
He had a lot of freedom.
-Too much, perhaps

517
01:13:31,501 --> 01:13:36,206
Not too much. You see, both my wife
and I work, and you know how it is

518
01:13:36,379 --> 01:13:38,076
I'm a father, too

519
01:13:38,951 --> 01:13:41,650
I must admit it's not always easy

520
01:13:41,824 --> 01:13:44,261
If only we could talk with him

521
01:13:44,430 --> 01:13:47,027
But he doesn't even listen

522
01:13:47,169 --> 01:13:51,736
You think he's listening now? Look
how I found him with the typewriter

523
01:13:51,912 --> 01:13:54,008
God only knows what goes on
in that head

524
01:13:56,756 --> 01:13:58,817
Take down his statement

525
01:14:00,130 --> 01:14:01,759
Vagrancy and theft

526
01:14:09,751 --> 01:14:12,952
So, what's your decision?
-In any case

527
01:14:13,125 --> 01:14:16,064
if I take him home,
he'll run away again

528
01:14:16,232 --> 01:14:19,763
I don't know. Maybe you
could send him some place

529
01:14:19,940 --> 01:14:24,542
to the countryside, where they'd
make him work. He won't study anymore

530
01:14:24,717 --> 01:14:29,250
We could put him in a house of
correction. They're well organized

531
01:14:29,427 --> 01:14:32,730
He'd learn a craft.
-That sounds fine

532
01:14:32,902 --> 01:14:35,031
If there's room for him, of course

533
01:14:35,975 --> 01:14:40,041
But you'll have to fill out an
application for the transfer of your

534
01:14:40,986 --> 01:14:43,685
parental rights to the Department
for the Juvenile Delinquents

535
01:14:44,761 --> 01:14:47,961
He'll appear in the Juvenile Court
tomorrow morning

536
01:14:48,134 --> 01:14:51,369
You or your wife must be present

537
01:14:53,380 --> 01:14:54,974
No one saw you enter the building?

538
01:14:56,921 --> 01:15:02,422
I hereby declare having broken
into the building and stole

539
01:15:09,715 --> 01:15:12,710
a typewriter

540
01:15:15,962 --> 01:15:17,761
Sign here

541
01:15:18,567 --> 01:15:21,597
He's all yours

542
01:15:37,208 --> 01:15:38,768
Take care of him.
I'm going home

543
01:16:14,656 --> 01:16:17,993
What did you do?
-I ran away from home

544
01:16:19,534 --> 01:16:20,935
And you?

545
01:16:22,039 --> 01:16:23,599
Oh, I

546
01:17:06,435 --> 01:17:07,836
Here come the girls

547
01:17:13,652 --> 01:17:17,057
I saw a police station
in a movie. It was cleaner

548
01:17:18,763 --> 01:17:21,792
I once saw a dirtier one.
-And I, more cheerful one

549
01:18:07,568 --> 01:18:08,969
The limo has arrived, folks

550
01:18:27,512 --> 01:18:28,673
Put on your jacket

551
01:20:26,538 --> 01:20:29,704
Tie, belt, shoe lace.
Empty your pockets

552
01:20:58,340 --> 01:20:59,433
Sign here

553
01:23:44,300 --> 01:23:46,771
Maybe we could take him back

554
01:23:46,939 --> 01:23:49,672
but he'd have to change drastically

555
01:23:49,846 --> 01:23:52,340
If only you could scare him,
Your Honor

556
01:23:52,519 --> 01:23:55,754
That's not my role.
-But we can't control him

557
01:23:55,926 --> 01:23:59,331
Or perhaps you're not
doing it the right way

558
01:23:59,500 --> 01:24:04,101
Tell me, is it true that he sometimes
spends his weekends home alone?

559
01:24:04,278 --> 01:24:09,312
My husband has a racing club.
It's possible we left him home alone

560
01:24:09,489 --> 01:24:14,090
but he hates sports. He spends
hours at the movies, ruining his eyes

561
01:24:15,104 --> 01:24:17,736
What does your husband have to say?
It's his son after all

562
01:24:19,683 --> 01:24:24,560
He's not. He married me when my child
was still a baby. -That's quite noble

563
01:24:26,200 --> 01:24:29,174
I shouldn't have told you.
-On the contrary

564
01:24:29,342 --> 01:24:32,008
I think we should place your child

565
01:24:32,182 --> 01:24:36,991
under observation in a special home.
-Could it be by the sea, Your Honor?

566
01:24:37,161 --> 01:24:39,098
We're not sending him
to Summer camp

567
01:24:40,036 --> 01:24:42,736
But I'll do my best depending
on what's available

568
01:24:43,478 --> 01:24:46,851
He'll stay there for 2 or 3 months
while I study his case

569
01:24:47,021 --> 01:24:48,514
Then, we'll take a decision

570
01:24:49,828 --> 01:24:52,528
Believe me, this change
will benefit him

571
01:24:52,702 --> 01:24:54,332
Goodbye, Your Honor.
-Goodbye

572
01:24:59,018 --> 01:25:02,585
OBSERVATION CENTER
FOR JUVENILE DELINQUENTS

573
01:25:38,488 --> 01:25:41,120
How did you end up here?
-And you?

574
01:25:41,295 --> 01:25:44,428
I made the wrong turn.
-I stole a typewriter

575
01:25:44,603 --> 01:25:47,168
A typewriter? That's dumb!
No wonder you got caught

576
01:25:47,344 --> 01:25:50,911
They're numbered

577
01:25:51,087 --> 01:25:54,027
You see that big guy?

578
01:25:54,196 --> 01:25:55,495
He stole car tires

579
01:25:57,170 --> 01:25:59,198
Each time I cried

580
01:25:59,375 --> 01:26:02,247
my father would imitate
me on his fiddle

581
01:26:02,417 --> 01:26:05,357
just to drive me nuts.
One day, I got fed up

582
01:26:05,525 --> 01:26:08,089
and I knocked him out

583
01:26:08,265 --> 01:26:10,898
Good for you. If I'd been you,
I would have killed him

584
01:26:14,716 --> 01:26:18,886
Who's that? They caught him.
He escaped a week ago

585
01:26:21,934 --> 01:26:24,772
You know, you can escape
but you can't get caught

586
01:26:33,966 --> 01:26:37,031
What are you doing here?
Line up! Quick

587
01:27:40,739 --> 01:27:42,072
Show me the bread

588
01:27:45,652 --> 01:27:46,916
You couldn't wait, eh?

589
01:27:47,824 --> 01:27:49,419
Bring your plate and bread here

590
01:28:01,426 --> 01:28:04,628
Right or left?
-Left, Sir

591
01:28:12,789 --> 01:28:14,190
And no talking

592
01:28:22,615 --> 01:28:27,720
-I brought you that.
I bet they'd catch you and I won

593
01:28:33,209 --> 01:28:36,183
So what? I had five days of fun

594
01:28:36,351 --> 01:28:39,792
I'll do it again.
-What are you doing here?

595
01:28:43,670 --> 01:28:45,573
Kanayan, to the psychologist

596
01:28:47,345 --> 01:28:50,616
If she drops her pen, pick it up
but don't look at her legs

597
01:28:50,788 --> 01:28:53,454
Or else, it will be on your record.
-My record?

598
01:28:53,629 --> 01:28:57,035
They keep a file on what everybody
thinks of you. The doctor, the judge

599
01:28:57,204 --> 01:28:59,403
even your parent's neighbors

600
01:28:59,577 --> 01:29:01,377
I know mine by heart

601
01:29:02,084 --> 01:29:06,221
I'm an unstable psychotic
individual with perverted tendencies

602
01:29:06,395 --> 01:29:09,767
What if I play dumb?
-Then, it's the funny farm

603
01:29:09,938 --> 01:29:12,410
or boot camp

604
01:29:19,061 --> 01:29:22,594
Why did you return the typewriter?
-Well

605
01:29:22,771 --> 01:29:25,107
since I couldn't sell it or anything

606
01:29:25,277 --> 01:29:30,245
I got scared. I don't know
why I returned it. Just like that

607
01:29:30,660 --> 01:29:34,258
I hear you stole 10.000 francs
from your grandmother

608
01:29:34,433 --> 01:29:37,599
She had invited me for her birthday

609
01:29:37,773 --> 01:29:40,869
I thought she is old, and doesn't
eat much. She doesn't need the money

610
01:29:41,046 --> 01:29:43,106
She was going to die soon

611
01:29:43,917 --> 01:29:47,583
So, since I knew where she kept
her dough, I took some

612
01:29:48,393 --> 01:29:52,594
I knew she wouldn't notice.
And she didn't

613
01:29:52,767 --> 01:29:55,705
She gave me a nice book that day

614
01:29:56,908 --> 01:30:01,280
But my mother, she used
to go through my pockets

615
01:30:01,449 --> 01:30:05,355
That night, while I was asleep

616
01:30:05,524 --> 01:30:08,518
she must have found the money in
my pocket cause next day it was gone

617
01:30:09,431 --> 01:30:13,895
Later, she mentioned it and
I had to confess where I got it

618
01:30:14,073 --> 01:30:17,272
And then she took the nice book away

619
01:30:18,346 --> 01:30:20,111
One day I asked for it back

620
01:30:21,252 --> 01:30:23,244
and I found out she'd sold it

621
01:30:25,293 --> 01:30:27,263
Your parents say you're always lying

622
01:30:28,499 --> 01:30:31,959
Oh, I lie, now and then, I suppose

623
01:30:32,139 --> 01:30:35,008
Sometimes, if I told them the truth

624
01:30:35,177 --> 01:30:37,010
they wouldn't believe me,
anyway. So I prefer to lie

625
01:30:37,749 --> 01:30:39,446
Why don't you like your mother?

626
01:30:40,453 --> 01:30:44,257
Well, she put me in a foster home
and then, when they had no more money

627
01:30:44,428 --> 01:30:45,691
I lived with my grandmother

628
01:30:46,966 --> 01:30:50,062
But then she got old and
she couldn't take care of me anymore

629
01:30:50,506 --> 01:30:54,502
So, when I was 8,
I went to live with my parents

630
01:30:54,679 --> 01:30:57,981
I could tell Mom didn't like me.
She was always

631
01:30:58,153 --> 01:31:00,589
yelling at me for no reason

632
01:31:01,759 --> 01:31:06,598
There were fights at home

633
01:31:07,770 --> 01:31:09,933
and I, I overheard

634
01:31:11,443 --> 01:31:17,751
that my mother had me
before she was married

635
01:31:17,922 --> 01:31:22,158
And she had a fight
with my grandmother once

636
01:31:22,330 --> 01:31:25,632
that's when I found out that
she had wanted to have an abortion

637
01:31:25,803 --> 01:31:27,635
It's thanks to my grandmother
that I was born

638
01:31:27,744 --> 01:31:29,445
Have you ever slept with a girl?

639
01:31:33,200 --> 01:31:37,310
No. But some friends of mine have

640
01:31:37,486 --> 01:31:40,955
They told me where
the hookers hang out

641
01:31:42,072 --> 01:31:46,021
And so I went, and I tried
to pick up some girls

642
01:31:46,191 --> 01:31:49,569
but they yelled at me.
So, I got scared and I left

643
01:31:49,738 --> 01:31:53,208
I went back several times

644
01:31:53,388 --> 01:31:55,762
Once a man asked me
what I was doing there

645
01:31:55,932 --> 01:31:58,877
He was North African. So I told him

646
01:31:59,046 --> 01:32:01,853
I guess he knew a lot of women.
He said he knew one

647
01:32:02,025 --> 01:32:08,076
a young one, who liked guys my age

648
01:32:09,223 --> 01:32:12,796
So he took me to
the hotel where she was

649
01:32:12,973 --> 01:32:15,610
only she wasn't there that day

650
01:32:15,785 --> 01:32:19,632
We waited an hour or two.
She didn't show up. So I left

651
01:33:18,323 --> 01:33:20,857
Don't look for your father,
I came alone. Over there?

652
01:33:45,977 --> 01:33:49,892
Your personal letter hurt
your father deeply

653
01:33:50,060 --> 01:33:52,697
and of course he showed it to me.
Whatever you may think

654
01:33:52,873 --> 01:33:55,543
we get along well

655
01:33:55,685 --> 01:33:59,029
I went through a difficult time, but
you didn't need to remind him of it

656
01:33:59,200 --> 01:34:01,471
He gave you his name, after all

657
01:34:03,820 --> 01:34:08,135
We were willing to try again
and take you back

658
01:34:08,306 --> 01:34:10,544
but the neighbors would talk.
You probably complained

659
01:34:10,716 --> 01:34:14,391
to the entire neighborhood.
-I didn't say anything, Mom

660
01:34:14,567 --> 01:34:18,380
I'm used to this anyway. I have
been criticized my entire life

661
01:34:18,550 --> 01:34:23,767
That's all I wanted to tell you.
And don't go crying to your father

662
01:34:24,034 --> 01:34:27,666
He told me to tell you
he doesn't care about you anymore

663
01:34:28,236 --> 01:34:30,910
So you will be sent to a Labor Center

664
01:34:31,942 --> 01:34:36,105
You wanted to work.
Well, now you'll see if you like it

664
01:34:37,305 --> 01:34:43,818
