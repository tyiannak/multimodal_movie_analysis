1
00:00:48,840 --> 00:00:51,301
Rachel, let me see.

2
00:00:57,390 --> 00:01:00,518
- Can I see?
- Finders keepers. And I found it.

3
00:01:00,685 --> 00:01:02,229
In my garden.

4
00:01:03,938 --> 00:01:05,773
Finders keepers.

5
00:01:12,739 --> 00:01:14,240
Bruce?

6
00:01:19,245 --> 00:01:20,955
Bruce?

7
00:01:23,291 --> 00:01:25,752
Mom! Mr. Alfred!

8
00:01:48,691 --> 00:01:50,860
Did you have dream?

9
00:01:51,319 --> 00:01:53,196
Nightmare.

10
00:01:57,575 --> 00:01:59,035
Worse than this place?

11
00:02:21,057 --> 00:02:23,017
They are going to fight you.

12
00:02:23,393 --> 00:02:25,019
- Again?
- Until they kill you.

13
00:02:27,230 --> 00:02:29,023
Can they kill me before breakfast?

14
00:02:31,401 --> 00:02:34,237
You are in hell, little man.

15
00:02:37,532 --> 00:02:40,326
And I am the devil.

16
00:02:43,705 --> 00:02:45,164
You're not the devil.

17
00:02:45,331 --> 00:02:46,708
You're practice.

18
00:03:30,168 --> 00:03:31,461
Solitary.

19
00:03:31,628 --> 00:03:33,546
- Why?
- For protection.

20
00:03:34,255 --> 00:03:36,591
- I don't need protection.
- Protection for them.

21
00:03:40,261 --> 00:03:42,263
Get in.

22
00:03:46,225 --> 00:03:48,269
Are you so desperate
to fight criminals...

23
00:03:48,436 --> 00:03:51,105
...that you lock yourself in
to take them on one at a time?

24
00:03:52,357 --> 00:03:56,277
Actually, there were seven of them.

25
00:03:56,444 --> 00:03:58,738
I counted six, Mr. Wayne.

26
00:04:02,492 --> 00:04:03,743
How do you know my name?

27
00:04:03,910 --> 00:04:06,955
The world is too small for someone
like Bruce Wayne to disappear...

28
00:04:07,121 --> 00:04:09,457
...no matter how deep
he chooses to sink.

29
00:04:09,624 --> 00:04:10,792
Who are you?

30
00:04:10,959 --> 00:04:14,128
My name is merely Ducard,
but I speak for Ra's al Ghul...

31
00:04:14,295 --> 00:04:17,924
...a man greatly feared
by the criminal underworld.

32
00:04:18,091 --> 00:04:19,676
A man who can offer you a path.

33
00:04:20,593 --> 00:04:23,096
What makes you think I need a path?

34
00:04:23,471 --> 00:04:26,099
Someone like you
is only here by choice.

35
00:04:26,266 --> 00:04:28,643
You have been exploring
the criminal fraternity...

36
00:04:28,810 --> 00:04:31,271
...but whatever
your original intentions...

37
00:04:31,980 --> 00:04:35,316
...you have become truly lost.

38
00:04:36,859 --> 00:04:40,655
And what path can Ra's al Ghul offer?

39
00:04:40,822 --> 00:04:44,826
The path of a man
who shares his hatred of evil...

40
00:04:44,993 --> 00:04:48,204
...and wishes to serve true justice.

41
00:04:48,663 --> 00:04:50,790
The path of the League of Shadows.

42
00:04:53,876 --> 00:04:56,170
- You're vigilantes.
- No, no, no.

43
00:04:56,337 --> 00:05:00,508
A vigilante is just a man lost in
the scramble for his own gratification.

44
00:05:00,675 --> 00:05:04,345
He can be destroyed or locked up.

45
00:05:05,722 --> 00:05:10,518
But if you make yourself more
than just a man...

46
00:05:10,685 --> 00:05:13,688
...if you devote yourself to an ideal...

47
00:05:13,855 --> 00:05:16,357
...and if they can't stop you...

48
00:05:16,733 --> 00:05:19,193
...then you become
something else entirely.

49
00:05:20,862 --> 00:05:22,405
Which is?

50
00:05:22,905 --> 00:05:25,867
Legend, Mr. Wayne.

51
00:05:27,201 --> 00:05:28,828
Tomorrow, you will be released.

52
00:05:28,995 --> 00:05:32,373
If you are bored of brawling with thieves
and want to achieve something...

53
00:05:32,540 --> 00:05:36,044
...there is a rare blue flower
that grows on the eastern slopes.

54
00:05:36,210 --> 00:05:37,879
Pick one of these flowers.

55
00:05:38,046 --> 00:05:41,007
If you can carry it
to the top of the mountain...

56
00:05:41,174 --> 00:05:44,093
...you may find what you were
looking for in the first place.

57
00:05:44,260 --> 00:05:47,013
And what was I looking for?

58
00:05:48,723 --> 00:05:50,683
Only you can know that.

59
00:06:57,834 --> 00:07:01,462
You turn back. You go back.

60
00:08:09,072 --> 00:08:11,074
Ra's al Ghul?

61
00:08:21,292 --> 00:08:22,877
Wait.

62
00:08:25,880 --> 00:08:27,173
What are you seeking?

63
00:08:28,091 --> 00:08:30,093
I seek...

64
00:08:31,636 --> 00:08:33,888
...the means to fight injustice.

65
00:08:34,264 --> 00:08:36,391
To turn fear...

66
00:08:36,724 --> 00:08:39,560
...against those
who prey on the fearful.

67
00:09:01,249 --> 00:09:04,335
To manipulate the fears in others...

68
00:09:05,169 --> 00:09:08,590
...you must first master your own.

69
00:09:09,132 --> 00:09:10,925
Are you ready to begin?

70
00:09:11,843 --> 00:09:14,429
I can... I can barely stand.

71
00:09:14,596 --> 00:09:16,931
Death does not wait
for you to be ready!

72
00:09:17,098 --> 00:09:20,268
Death is not considerate or fair!

73
00:09:20,768 --> 00:09:25,398
And make no mistake,
here you face death.

74
00:09:29,277 --> 00:09:30,612
Tiger.

75
00:09:32,238 --> 00:09:34,032
Jujitsu.

76
00:09:36,242 --> 00:09:37,285
Panther.

77
00:09:40,788 --> 00:09:43,124
You're skilled. But this is not a dance.

78
00:09:48,588 --> 00:09:50,131
And you are afraid.

79
00:09:53,092 --> 00:09:54,969
But not of me.

80
00:09:58,431 --> 00:10:00,934
Tell us, Mr. Wayne...

81
00:10:05,438 --> 00:10:08,608
...what do you fear?

82
00:10:17,742 --> 00:10:19,160
Bruce?

83
00:10:21,829 --> 00:10:24,332
It's okay. It's okay.

84
00:10:24,499 --> 00:10:26,000
You'll be okay.

85
00:10:26,251 --> 00:10:28,544
Will we be needing an ambulance,
Master Wayne?

86
00:10:28,711 --> 00:10:31,714
No, I'll set the bone
and take him for an x-ray later.

87
00:10:31,881 --> 00:10:33,132
Very good, sir.

88
00:10:33,591 --> 00:10:37,303
- I'm very sorry, sir. I've told...
- Don't worry. It's fine.

89
00:10:39,597 --> 00:10:41,557
Took quite a fall, didn't we,
Master Bruce?

90
00:10:41,724 --> 00:10:43,017
And why do we fall, Bruce?

91
00:10:43,351 --> 00:10:46,437
So we can learn to pick ourselves up.

92
00:10:50,233 --> 00:10:53,069
Just a little fall.
It's just a small fracture.

93
00:11:02,036 --> 00:11:03,871
The bats again?

94
00:11:07,041 --> 00:11:09,168
You know why they attacked you,
don't you?

95
00:11:09,669 --> 00:11:12,714
- They were afraid of you.
- Afraid of me?

96
00:11:12,880 --> 00:11:14,882
All creatures feel fear.

97
00:11:15,049 --> 00:11:16,384
Even the scary ones?

98
00:11:16,551 --> 00:11:18,428
Especially the scary ones.

99
00:11:18,803 --> 00:11:20,597
I got something to show you.

100
00:11:24,892 --> 00:11:28,229
- You think your mother will like them?
- Yeah.

101
00:11:28,896 --> 00:11:31,065
- I think it's time to get up.
- Maybe.

102
00:11:31,232 --> 00:11:32,859
No going back to bed.

103
00:11:36,070 --> 00:11:38,197
Did you build this train, Dad?

104
00:11:38,364 --> 00:11:43,077
Gotham's been good to our family,
but the city's been suffering.

105
00:11:43,244 --> 00:11:46,748
People less fortunate than us
have been enduring very hard times.

106
00:11:46,915 --> 00:11:50,877
So we built a new, cheap, public
transportation system to unite the city.

107
00:11:51,044 --> 00:11:52,754
And at the center...

108
00:11:52,921 --> 00:11:54,756
...Wayne Tower.

109
00:11:54,923 --> 00:11:57,800
- Is that where you work?
- No, I work at the hospital.

110
00:11:57,967 --> 00:12:01,179
I leave the running of our company
to much better men.

111
00:12:01,346 --> 00:12:03,222
- Better?
- Well...

112
00:12:03,389 --> 00:12:05,642
...more interested men.

113
00:13:02,031 --> 00:13:03,449
Can we go?

114
00:13:05,827 --> 00:13:07,328
Please.

115
00:13:07,912 --> 00:13:09,956
Okay. Let's go.

116
00:13:19,173 --> 00:13:22,051
- What's wrong, Bruce?
- No, no. It was me.

117
00:13:22,218 --> 00:13:24,345
I just needed some fresh air.

118
00:13:24,512 --> 00:13:27,682
A little bit of opera goes a long way.
Right, Bruce?

119
00:13:30,310 --> 00:13:33,021
Come on. Let's go.

120
00:13:38,484 --> 00:13:40,236
Wallets, jewelry. Come on, fast.

121
00:13:40,403 --> 00:13:41,779
- That's fine.
- Fast.

122
00:13:41,946 --> 00:13:43,531
Take it easy.

123
00:13:44,198 --> 00:13:45,742
Take it easy.

124
00:13:46,534 --> 00:13:47,994
Here you go.

125
00:13:50,747 --> 00:13:53,583
It's fine. It's fine.

126
00:13:54,459 --> 00:13:57,587
Now just take it and go.

127
00:13:57,754 --> 00:13:59,547
- I said, jewelry.
- Hey...

128
00:14:01,591 --> 00:14:02,926
Thomas!

129
00:14:10,934 --> 00:14:12,560
Bruce.

130
00:14:15,188 --> 00:14:16,564
It's okay.

131
00:14:19,734 --> 00:14:21,444
Don't be afraid.

132
00:14:53,268 --> 00:14:55,061
Is this your father's?

133
00:14:56,604 --> 00:14:58,731
It's okay.

134
00:14:59,941 --> 00:15:01,567
Come here.

135
00:15:04,279 --> 00:15:06,489
There you go.

136
00:15:09,617 --> 00:15:11,619
It's okay.

137
00:15:13,371 --> 00:15:15,290
It's okay.

138
00:15:19,294 --> 00:15:20,795
Gordon.

139
00:15:28,886 --> 00:15:30,471
Hey.

140
00:15:31,097 --> 00:15:32,307
Good news.

141
00:15:33,766 --> 00:15:35,643
We got him, son.

142
00:15:56,289 --> 00:15:58,166
You're in excellent hands.

143
00:15:58,333 --> 00:16:00,001
We'll be watching the empire.

144
00:16:00,168 --> 00:16:03,171
When you grow up,
it'll be waiting for you.

145
00:16:19,187 --> 00:16:22,315
I thought I might prepare
a little supper.

146
00:16:27,487 --> 00:16:29,572
- Very well.
- Alfred?

147
00:16:33,534 --> 00:16:35,536
- Yes, Master Bruce?
- It was my fault, Alfred.

148
00:16:35,703 --> 00:16:37,372
- I made them leave the theater.
- No.

149
00:16:37,538 --> 00:16:40,583
- If I hadn't gotten scared...
- It was nothing that you did.

150
00:16:41,709 --> 00:16:45,046
It was him, and him alone.

151
00:16:45,546 --> 00:16:47,048
Do you understand?

152
00:16:50,176 --> 00:16:53,221
I miss them, Alfred.
I miss them so much.

153
00:16:53,388 --> 00:16:55,390
So do I, Master Bruce.

154
00:16:57,809 --> 00:16:59,060
So do I.

155
00:17:01,187 --> 00:17:04,148
And do you still feel responsible
for your parents' death?

156
00:17:04,315 --> 00:17:06,442
My anger outweighs my guilt.

157
00:17:07,193 --> 00:17:08,569
Come.

158
00:17:13,241 --> 00:17:15,952
You have learned to bury
your guilt with anger.

159
00:17:16,119 --> 00:17:19,163
I will teach you to confront it
and to face the truth.

160
00:17:21,666 --> 00:17:26,629
You know how to fight six men.
We can teach you how to engage 600.

161
00:17:27,880 --> 00:17:29,757
You know how to disappear.

162
00:17:29,924 --> 00:17:32,135
We can teach you
to become truly invisible.

163
00:17:33,761 --> 00:17:35,471
Invisible?

164
00:17:39,475 --> 00:17:44,105
The ninja understands that invisibility
is a matter of patience and agility.

165
00:17:57,076 --> 00:17:58,786
Always mind your surroundings.

166
00:18:01,956 --> 00:18:04,167
Ninjitsu employs explosive powders.

167
00:18:05,668 --> 00:18:07,921
- As weapons?
- Or distractions.

168
00:18:08,087 --> 00:18:10,423
Theatricality and deception
are powerful agents.

169
00:18:10,882 --> 00:18:13,927
You must become more than just a man
in the mind of your opponent.

170
00:18:16,220 --> 00:18:18,348
- Who is he?
- He was a farmer.

171
00:18:18,514 --> 00:18:21,768
Then he tried to take his neighbor's land
and became a murderer.

172
00:18:21,935 --> 00:18:24,228
- Now he is a prisoner.
- What'll happen to him?

173
00:18:24,395 --> 00:18:26,814
Justice. Crime cannot be tolerated.

174
00:18:26,981 --> 00:18:30,944
Criminals thrive on the indulgence
of society's understanding.

175
00:18:34,989 --> 00:18:37,825
Your parents' death
was not your fault.

176
00:18:46,167 --> 00:18:47,418
It was your father's.

177
00:19:08,314 --> 00:19:11,150
Anger does not change the fact
that your father failed to act.

178
00:19:11,317 --> 00:19:13,528
- The man had a gun.
- Would that stop you?

179
00:19:14,320 --> 00:19:15,530
I've had training.

180
00:19:15,697 --> 00:19:17,532
The training is nothing!

181
00:19:17,699 --> 00:19:19,367
Will is everything!

182
00:19:25,164 --> 00:19:27,000
The will to act.

183
00:19:36,759 --> 00:19:38,011
Yield.

184
00:19:38,303 --> 00:19:39,721
You haven't beaten me.

185
00:19:39,887 --> 00:19:42,599
You have sacrificed sure footing
for a killing stroke.

186
00:19:50,231 --> 00:19:52,025
Rub your chest.

187
00:19:52,525 --> 00:19:55,403
Your arms will
take care of themselves.

188
00:19:58,072 --> 00:19:59,699
You are stronger than your father.

189
00:20:00,366 --> 00:20:01,993
You didn't know my father.

190
00:20:02,160 --> 00:20:04,454
But I know the rage that drives you.

191
00:20:04,621 --> 00:20:06,915
That impossible anger
strangling the grief...

192
00:20:07,081 --> 00:20:09,751
...until the memory
of your loved one is just...

193
00:20:09,918 --> 00:20:11,920
...poison in your veins.

194
00:20:12,086 --> 00:20:16,549
And one day, you catch yourself wishing
the person you loved had never existed...

195
00:20:17,967 --> 00:20:20,428
...so you'd be spared your pain.

196
00:20:23,431 --> 00:20:26,809
I wasn't always here in the mountains.

197
00:20:28,436 --> 00:20:30,480
Once, I had a wife.

198
00:20:31,439 --> 00:20:33,358
My great love.

199
00:20:34,525 --> 00:20:36,653
She was taken from me.

200
00:20:36,819 --> 00:20:40,031
Like you, I was forced to learn
there are those without decency...

201
00:20:40,198 --> 00:20:43,493
...who must be fought
without hesitation, without pity.

202
00:20:45,286 --> 00:20:47,622
Your anger gives you great power.

203
00:20:48,122 --> 00:20:51,668
But if you let it, it will destroy you...

204
00:20:52,210 --> 00:20:54,128
...as it almost did me.

205
00:20:54,295 --> 00:20:57,006
- What stopped it?
- Vengeance.

206
00:20:57,173 --> 00:20:59,133
That's no help to me.

207
00:20:59,300 --> 00:21:01,135
Why, Bruce?

208
00:21:01,302 --> 00:21:03,972
Why could you not
avenge your parents?

209
00:21:07,809 --> 00:21:11,271
Will you be heading back to Princeton
after the hearing, sir...

210
00:21:11,437 --> 00:21:14,107
...or can I persuade you to stay on
for a day or two?

211
00:21:14,274 --> 00:21:16,484
I'm not heading back at all.

212
00:21:16,651 --> 00:21:18,695
- You don't like it there?
- I like it fine.

213
00:21:19,112 --> 00:21:21,906
They just don't feel the same way.

214
00:21:22,699 --> 00:21:26,369
- I've prepared the master bedroom.
- No.

215
00:21:26,536 --> 00:21:27,954
My room will be fine.

216
00:21:28,121 --> 00:21:30,665
With all due respect, sir,
Wayne Manor is your house.

217
00:21:30,832 --> 00:21:32,667
No, Alfred, it's my father's house.

218
00:21:32,834 --> 00:21:35,211
- Your father is dead.
- This place is a mausoleum.

219
00:21:35,378 --> 00:21:38,423
If I have my way, I'll pull
the damn thing down brick by brick.

220
00:21:38,590 --> 00:21:42,677
This house, Master Wayne, has sheltered
six generations of your family.

221
00:21:42,844 --> 00:21:45,555
Why do you give a damn, Alfred?
It's not your family.

222
00:21:46,389 --> 00:21:50,268
I give a damn because a good man
once made me responsible...

223
00:21:50,935 --> 00:21:53,104
...for what was
most precious to him...

224
00:21:53,271 --> 00:21:55,523
...in the whole world.

225
00:21:57,483 --> 00:22:01,029
Miss Dawes has offered
to drive you to the hearing.

226
00:22:01,195 --> 00:22:03,239
She probably hopes
to talk you out of going.

227
00:22:03,406 --> 00:22:06,868
Should I just bury the past out there
with my parents, Alfred?

228
00:22:07,035 --> 00:22:10,121
I wouldn't presume to tell you
what to do with your past, sir.

229
00:22:10,288 --> 00:22:14,334
Just know that there are those of us who
care about what you do with your future.

230
00:22:15,710 --> 00:22:17,211
Haven't given up on me yet?

231
00:22:17,879 --> 00:22:19,380
Never.

232
00:23:07,929 --> 00:23:11,349
Alfred still keeps the condensed milk
on the top shelf.

233
00:23:12,225 --> 00:23:14,143
Hasn't he noticed
you're tall enough to reach now?

234
00:23:14,310 --> 00:23:15,603
Old habits die hard, I guess.

235
00:23:15,979 --> 00:23:18,564
- Never used to stop us anyway.
- No, it didn't.

236
00:23:18,731 --> 00:23:20,608
How's your mom?

237
00:23:21,025 --> 00:23:23,278
She misses this place.

238
00:23:24,779 --> 00:23:26,281
So do I.

239
00:23:26,698 --> 00:23:27,949
Yeah.

240
00:23:28,116 --> 00:23:31,119
But it's nothing without the people
who made it what it was.

241
00:23:31,286 --> 00:23:34,289
- Now there's only Alfred.
- And you.

242
00:23:34,455 --> 00:23:38,001
- I'm not staying, Rachel.
- You're just back for the hearing.

243
00:23:41,629 --> 00:23:45,800
Bruce, I don't suppose there's any way
to convince you not to come.

244
00:23:46,134 --> 00:23:49,637
Someone at this proceeding...

245
00:23:50,305 --> 00:23:52,473
...should stand for my parents.

246
00:23:52,640 --> 00:23:54,767
We all loved your parents, Bruce.

247
00:23:54,934 --> 00:23:58,146
- What Chill did is unforgivable.
- Then why is your boss letting him go?

248
00:23:59,522 --> 00:24:02,775
In prison, he shared a cell
with Carmine Falcone.

249
00:24:02,942 --> 00:24:06,613
He learned things, and he will testify
in exchange for early parole.

250
00:24:06,779 --> 00:24:09,449
Rachel, this man killed my parents.

251
00:24:11,451 --> 00:24:13,161
I cannot let that pass.

252
00:24:13,328 --> 00:24:16,205
And I need you
to understand that, please.

253
00:24:17,957 --> 00:24:19,167
Okay.

254
00:24:20,251 --> 00:24:23,588
The depression hit working people,
like Mr. Chill, hardest of all.

255
00:24:23,755 --> 00:24:26,966
His crime was appalling, yes,
but it was motivated not by greed...

256
00:24:27,300 --> 00:24:28,968
...but by desperation.

257
00:24:29,135 --> 00:24:33,056
Given the 14 years served, as well as
his extraordinary level of cooperation...

258
00:24:33,222 --> 00:24:35,850
...with one of this office's
most important investigations...

259
00:24:36,017 --> 00:24:39,145
...we strongly endorse his petition
for early release.

260
00:24:40,146 --> 00:24:42,440
Mr. Chill?

261
00:24:46,027 --> 00:24:47,695
Your Honor...

262
00:24:48,571 --> 00:24:51,699
...not a day goes by that I don't wish
I could take back what I did.

263
00:24:54,327 --> 00:24:57,580
Sure, I was desperate,
like a lot of people back then...

264
00:24:57,747 --> 00:25:00,083
...but that don't change what I did.

265
00:25:03,711 --> 00:25:08,383
I gather there is a member
of the Wayne family here today.

266
00:25:08,549 --> 00:25:10,843
Has he got anything to say?

267
00:25:25,566 --> 00:25:28,403
- He's coming out the side!
- He's coming out the side, guys!

268
00:25:38,079 --> 00:25:39,372
Bruce Wayne!

269
00:25:42,208 --> 00:25:43,418
Joe! Hey, Joe!

270
00:25:43,585 --> 00:25:45,086
Falcone says hi.

271
00:25:55,430 --> 00:25:59,017
Come on, Bruce.
We don't need to see this.

272
00:25:59,767 --> 00:26:01,311
I do.

273
00:26:06,441 --> 00:26:08,443
The DA couldn't understand
why Judge Faden...

274
00:26:08,610 --> 00:26:10,445
...insisted on making the hearing public.

275
00:26:10,612 --> 00:26:13,031
Falcone paid him off
to get Chill out in the open.

276
00:26:13,239 --> 00:26:14,490
Maybe I should thank them.

277
00:26:14,657 --> 00:26:17,243
- You don't mean that.
- What if I do, Rachel?

278
00:26:17,410 --> 00:26:19,329
My parents deserved justice.

279
00:26:19,495 --> 00:26:22,415
You're not talking about justice.
You're talking about revenge.

280
00:26:22,582 --> 00:26:25,460
- Sometimes, they're the same.
- No, they're never the same.

281
00:26:25,627 --> 00:26:29,213
Justice is about harmony. Revenge is
about you making yourself feel better.

282
00:26:29,380 --> 00:26:32,675
- It's why we have an impartial system.
- Your system is broken.

283
00:26:39,766 --> 00:26:42,602
You care about justice?
Look beyond your own pain, Bruce.

284
00:26:43,019 --> 00:26:44,479
This city is rotting.

285
00:26:44,646 --> 00:26:47,440
They talk about the depression
as if it's history. It's not.

286
00:26:47,607 --> 00:26:49,108
Things are worse than ever here.

287
00:26:49,275 --> 00:26:51,819
Falcone floods our streets
with crime and drugs...

288
00:26:51,986 --> 00:26:54,948
...preying on the desperate,
creating new Joe Chills every day.

289
00:26:55,114 --> 00:26:57,659
Falcone may not have killed
your parents, Bruce...

290
00:26:58,284 --> 00:27:00,787
...but he's destroying everything
that they stood for.

291
00:27:05,333 --> 00:27:08,211
You wanna thank him for that?
Here you go.

292
00:27:10,088 --> 00:27:13,132
We all know where to find him.
As long as he keeps the bad people rich...

293
00:27:13,299 --> 00:27:15,385
...and the good people scared,
no one'll touch him.

294
00:27:15,551 --> 00:27:19,847
Good people like your parents, who'll
stand against injustice, they're gone.

295
00:27:20,014 --> 00:27:23,726
What chance does Gotham have
when the good people do nothing?

296
00:27:24,602 --> 00:27:28,022
- I'm not one of your good people, Rachel.
- What do you mean?

297
00:27:30,275 --> 00:27:33,319
All these years, I wanted to kill him.

298
00:27:34,112 --> 00:27:35,697
Now I can't.

299
00:27:51,588 --> 00:27:53,298
Your father would be ashamed of you.

300
00:28:36,758 --> 00:28:39,260
You're taller than you look
in the tabloids, Mr. Wayne.

301
00:28:39,719 --> 00:28:41,596
No gun? I'm insulted.

302
00:28:44,766 --> 00:28:48,561
- You could've just sent a thank-you note.
- I didn't come here to thank you.

303
00:28:48,728 --> 00:28:51,481
I came to show you that
not everyone in Gotham's afraid of you.

304
00:28:51,648 --> 00:28:53,274
Only those who know me, kid.

305
00:28:53,608 --> 00:28:56,110
Look around you.
You'll see two councilmen...

306
00:28:56,444 --> 00:28:59,280
...a union official,
couple off-duty cops...

307
00:28:59,697 --> 00:29:01,324
...and a judge.

308
00:29:01,491 --> 00:29:05,787
I wouldn't have a second's hesitation of
blowing your head off in front of them.

309
00:29:05,954 --> 00:29:08,665
Now, that's power you can't buy.

310
00:29:09,290 --> 00:29:10,750
That's the power of fear.

311
00:29:11,167 --> 00:29:12,418
I'm not afraid of you.

312
00:29:12,585 --> 00:29:14,504
Because you think you got
nothing to lose.

313
00:29:14,671 --> 00:29:16,339
But you haven't thought it through.

314
00:29:16,506 --> 00:29:19,592
You haven't thought about
your lady friend in the DA's office.

315
00:29:19,759 --> 00:29:22,178
You haven't thought about
your old butler.

316
00:29:26,307 --> 00:29:28,643
People from your world...

317
00:29:28,810 --> 00:29:31,187
...have so much to lose.

318
00:29:31,354 --> 00:29:35,692
Now, you think because your mommy
and your daddy got shot...

319
00:29:35,858 --> 00:29:38,820
...you know about the ugly side of life,
but you don't.

320
00:29:38,987 --> 00:29:41,114
You've never tasted desperate.

321
00:29:41,281 --> 00:29:43,825
You're... You're Bruce Wayne,
the prince of Gotham.

322
00:29:43,992 --> 00:29:47,412
You'd have to go 1000 miles to meet
someone who didn't know your name.

323
00:29:47,579 --> 00:29:51,874
So don't come here with your anger,
trying to prove something to yourself.

324
00:29:52,041 --> 00:29:54,168
This is a world
you'll never understand.

325
00:29:54,335 --> 00:29:56,337
And you always fear...

326
00:29:56,504 --> 00:29:58,965
...what you don't understand.

327
00:30:01,843 --> 00:30:03,219
All right.

328
00:30:10,852 --> 00:30:13,688
Yeah, you got spirit, kid.
I'll give you that.

329
00:30:13,855 --> 00:30:15,857
More than your old man anyway.

330
00:30:16,024 --> 00:30:20,320
In the joint, Chill told me about
the night he killed your parents.

331
00:30:20,486 --> 00:30:22,697
He said your father begged for mercy.

332
00:30:24,073 --> 00:30:25,825
Begged.

333
00:30:25,992 --> 00:30:27,368
Like a dog.

334
00:30:40,214 --> 00:30:42,008
Should've tipped better.

335
00:30:52,018 --> 00:30:53,853
- For what?
- Your jacket.

336
00:30:54,395 --> 00:30:56,022
Okay.

337
00:30:57,106 --> 00:31:00,568
Hey, hey, hey. Let me have it.
It's a nice coat.

338
00:31:00,735 --> 00:31:02,862
Be careful who sees you with that.

339
00:31:03,446 --> 00:31:05,365
- They're gonna come looking for me.
- Who?

340
00:31:05,823 --> 00:31:07,533
Everyone.

341
00:31:09,827 --> 00:31:11,579
It's...

342
00:31:11,746 --> 00:31:13,748
It's a nice coat.

343
00:31:32,058 --> 00:31:36,437
When you lived among the criminals,
did you start to pity them?

344
00:31:36,604 --> 00:31:40,275
The first time I stole
so that I wouldn 't starve, yes.

345
00:31:40,483 --> 00:31:45,947
I lost many assumptions about
the simple nature of right and wrong.

346
00:31:47,240 --> 00:31:49,325
And when I traveled...

347
00:31:49,492 --> 00:31:52,203
...I learned the fear before a crime...

348
00:31:52,954 --> 00:31:55,540
...and the thrill of success.

349
00:31:57,417 --> 00:31:59,294
But I never became one of them.

350
00:32:02,755 --> 00:32:05,675
Fool. What do I care what your name is?
You're a criminal.

351
00:32:07,135 --> 00:32:08,928
Tell that to the guy who owned these.

352
00:32:12,140 --> 00:32:16,102
You've traveled the world to understand
the criminal mind and conquer your fears.

353
00:32:18,187 --> 00:32:22,317
But a criminal is not complicated.

354
00:32:22,483 --> 00:32:25,820
And what you really fear
is inside yourself.

355
00:32:25,987 --> 00:32:28,531
You fear your own power.

356
00:32:28,698 --> 00:32:29,991
You fear your anger...

357
00:32:30,450 --> 00:32:34,704
...the drive to do great
or terrible things.

358
00:32:34,871 --> 00:32:38,333
Now you must journey inwards.

359
00:32:42,086 --> 00:32:44,172
You are ready.

360
00:32:45,173 --> 00:32:46,591
Breathe.

361
00:32:56,142 --> 00:32:58,019
Breathe.

362
00:33:03,024 --> 00:33:04,859
Breathe in your fears.

363
00:33:07,487 --> 00:33:08,529
Face them.

364
00:33:10,031 --> 00:33:12,825
To conquer fear,
you must become fear.

365
00:33:12,992 --> 00:33:16,371
You must bask in the fear
of other men.

366
00:33:17,830 --> 00:33:21,251
And men fear most
what they cannot see.

367
00:33:38,476 --> 00:33:41,354
You have to become a terrible thought.

368
00:33:45,900 --> 00:33:47,110
A wraith.

369
00:33:52,824 --> 00:33:55,201
You have to become an idea!

370
00:34:02,083 --> 00:34:05,128
Feel terror cloud your senses.

371
00:34:06,879 --> 00:34:10,091
Feel its power to distort.

372
00:34:11,050 --> 00:34:13,261
To control.

373
00:34:16,347 --> 00:34:20,143
And know that this power
can be yours.

374
00:34:32,697 --> 00:34:35,366
Embrace your worst fear.

375
00:34:42,373 --> 00:34:44,667
Become one with the darkness.

376
00:35:04,479 --> 00:35:06,189
Focus.

377
00:35:06,481 --> 00:35:08,650
Concentrate.

378
00:35:08,816 --> 00:35:10,944
Master your senses.

379
00:35:39,013 --> 00:35:41,474
You cannot leave any sign.

380
00:35:41,849 --> 00:35:43,059
I haven't.

381
00:35:51,359 --> 00:35:53,361
Impressive.

382
00:36:02,829 --> 00:36:04,539
We have purged your fear.

383
00:36:05,707 --> 00:36:07,333
You are ready to lead these men.

384
00:36:07,500 --> 00:36:11,045
You are ready to become a member
of the League of Shadows.

385
00:36:13,673 --> 00:36:17,844
But first, you must demonstrate
your commitment to justice.

386
00:36:34,569 --> 00:36:35,945
No.

387
00:36:37,405 --> 00:36:38,698
I'm no executioner.

388
00:36:39,240 --> 00:36:42,911
Your compassion is a weakness
your enemies will not share.

389
00:36:43,286 --> 00:36:45,580
That's why it's so important.

390
00:36:45,830 --> 00:36:47,582
It separates us from them.

391
00:36:47,749 --> 00:36:50,126
You want to fight criminals.
This man is a murderer.

392
00:36:50,293 --> 00:36:52,086
- This man should be tried.
- By whom?

393
00:36:52,253 --> 00:36:53,963
Corrupt bureaucrats?

394
00:36:54,130 --> 00:36:56,633
Criminals mock society's laws.

395
00:36:56,799 --> 00:36:59,093
You know this better than most.

396
00:36:59,969 --> 00:37:02,597
You cannot lead these men...

397
00:37:02,764 --> 00:37:06,768
...unless you are prepared to do
what is necessary to defeat evil.

398
00:37:07,352 --> 00:37:09,771
And where would I be leading
these men?

399
00:37:10,313 --> 00:37:11,606
Gotham.

400
00:37:11,773 --> 00:37:13,816
As Gotham's favored son...

401
00:37:13,983 --> 00:37:18,321
...you will be ideally placed
to strike at the heart of criminality.

402
00:37:18,696 --> 00:37:22,450
- How?
- Gotham's time has come.

403
00:37:22,617 --> 00:37:25,954
Like Constantinople
or Rome before it...

404
00:37:26,120 --> 00:37:30,333
...the city has become a breeding ground
for suffering and injustice.

405
00:37:30,500 --> 00:37:34,128
It is beyond saving
and must be allowed to die.

406
00:37:34,295 --> 00:37:39,467
This is the most important function
of the League of Shadows.

407
00:37:39,759 --> 00:37:42,845
It is one we've performed
for centuries.

408
00:37:43,179 --> 00:37:44,931
Gotham...

409
00:37:45,098 --> 00:37:47,976
...must be destroyed.

410
00:37:51,312 --> 00:37:52,814
You can't believe in this.

411
00:37:53,022 --> 00:37:57,569
Ra's al Ghul rescued us from
the darkest corners of our own hearts.

412
00:37:57,735 --> 00:38:02,156
What he asks in return is the courage
to do what is necessary.

413
00:38:02,365 --> 00:38:05,702
I will go back to Gotham
and I will fight men like this...

414
00:38:05,868 --> 00:38:08,454
...but I will not
become an executioner.

415
00:38:08,621 --> 00:38:10,164
Bruce, please.

416
00:38:10,331 --> 00:38:13,167
For your own sake,
there is no turning back.

417
00:38:45,533 --> 00:38:48,077
- What are you doing?
- What's necessary, my friend.

418
00:41:04,505 --> 00:41:07,634
I will tell him you saved his life.

419
00:41:26,361 --> 00:41:28,905
Master Wayne,
you've been gone a long time.

420
00:41:29,072 --> 00:41:31,366
- Yes, I have.
- You look very fashionable.

421
00:41:32,867 --> 00:41:34,369
Apart from the mud.

422
00:41:34,619 --> 00:41:37,288
Are you coming back to Gotham
for long, sir?

423
00:41:37,455 --> 00:41:38,706
As long as it takes.

424
00:41:38,873 --> 00:41:40,375
I want to show the people...

425
00:41:40,541 --> 00:41:43,962
...their city doesn't belong
to the criminals and the corrupt.

426
00:41:44,128 --> 00:41:47,340
In the depression, your father nearly
bankrupted Wayne Enterprises...

427
00:41:47,507 --> 00:41:48,716
...combating poverty.

428
00:41:48,925 --> 00:41:53,429
He believed his example could inspire
the wealthy of Gotham to save their city.

429
00:41:53,721 --> 00:41:55,348
Did it?

430
00:41:56,474 --> 00:41:57,934
In a way.

431
00:41:58,101 --> 00:42:01,187
Their murder shocked the wealthy
and the powerful into action.

432
00:42:03,189 --> 00:42:06,234
People need dramatic examples
to shake them out of apathy.

433
00:42:06,401 --> 00:42:08,069
I can't do that as Bruce Wayne.

434
00:42:08,236 --> 00:42:09,779
As a man...

435
00:42:09,946 --> 00:42:12,365
...I'm flesh and blood,
I can be ignored, destroyed.

436
00:42:12,532 --> 00:42:14,450
But as a symbol...

437
00:42:15,910 --> 00:42:18,580
As a symbol, I can be incorruptible.

438
00:42:18,746 --> 00:42:21,374
- I can be everlasting.
- What symbol?

439
00:42:21,958 --> 00:42:24,627
Something elemental...

440
00:42:24,794 --> 00:42:26,421
...something terrifying.

441
00:42:26,588 --> 00:42:28,715
I assume that as you take on
the underworld...

442
00:42:28,881 --> 00:42:34,012
...this symbol is a persona to protect
those you care about from reprisals?

443
00:42:34,178 --> 00:42:35,555
You're thinking about Rachel?

444
00:42:35,722 --> 00:42:38,099
Actually, sir, I was thinking of myself.

445
00:42:40,101 --> 00:42:41,853
Have you told anyone
I'm coming back?

446
00:42:42,061 --> 00:42:46,274
I couldn't figure the legal ramifications
of bringing you back from the dead.

447
00:42:46,441 --> 00:42:48,318
- Dead?
- You've been gone seven years.

448
00:42:48,484 --> 00:42:49,777
You had me declared dead?

449
00:42:49,944 --> 00:42:52,822
Actually, it was Mr. Earle.
He's taking the company public.

450
00:42:52,989 --> 00:42:55,241
He wanted to liquidate
your majority shareholding.

451
00:42:55,450 --> 00:42:57,785
Those shares are worth
quite a bit of money.

452
00:42:57,952 --> 00:43:00,663
Well, it's a good thing
I left everything to you, then.

453
00:43:01,205 --> 00:43:02,832
Quite so, sir.

454
00:43:02,999 --> 00:43:06,753
And you can borrow the Rolls, if you like.
Just bring it back with a full tank.

455
00:43:16,804 --> 00:43:21,517
In my opinion, Mr. Zsaz is as much
a danger to himself as to others...

456
00:43:21,893 --> 00:43:26,481
...and prison is probably not the best
environment for his rehabilitation.

457
00:43:28,775 --> 00:43:31,361
- Dr. Crane.
- Miss Dawes.

458
00:43:31,527 --> 00:43:34,822
You think a man who butchers people
for the mob doesn't belong in jail?

459
00:43:34,989 --> 00:43:37,659
I would hardly have testified to that
otherwise, would I?

460
00:43:37,825 --> 00:43:40,912
This is the third of Falcone's thugs
you've had declared insane...

461
00:43:41,079 --> 00:43:42,497
...and moved into your asylum.

462
00:43:42,705 --> 00:43:47,335
The work offered by organized crime
must have an attraction to the insane.

463
00:43:48,878 --> 00:43:50,880
Or the corrupt.

464
00:43:53,132 --> 00:43:54,717
Mr. Finch.

465
00:43:55,051 --> 00:43:56,844
You should check
with Miss Dawes here...

466
00:43:57,011 --> 00:44:01,391
...just what implications your office
has authorized her to make. If any.

467
00:44:05,353 --> 00:44:07,689
- What are you doing?
- What are you doing, Carl?

468
00:44:07,855 --> 00:44:09,232
Looking out for you.

469
00:44:11,734 --> 00:44:14,654
Falcone has half the city
bought and paid for.

470
00:44:14,821 --> 00:44:16,864
- Drop it.
- How can you say that?

471
00:44:17,031 --> 00:44:20,743
Because as much as I care about
getting Falcone, I care more about you.

472
00:44:20,910 --> 00:44:22,203
That's sweet.

473
00:44:27,625 --> 00:44:30,003
We've been through all that.

474
00:44:56,070 --> 00:44:57,530
Blessed bat again, sir.

475
00:44:57,989 --> 00:45:00,408
They nest somewhere in the grounds.

476
00:46:58,276 --> 00:47:00,987
No more favors.
Someone is sniffing around.

477
00:47:01,154 --> 00:47:04,115
Hey, I scratch your back,
you scratch mine, doc.

478
00:47:04,282 --> 00:47:05,658
I'm bringing in the shipments.

479
00:47:06,367 --> 00:47:07,577
We are paying you for that.

480
00:47:07,744 --> 00:47:10,246
Maybe money isn't as interesting
to me as favors.

481
00:47:12,749 --> 00:47:17,545
I am more than aware that you are
not intimidated by me, Mr. Falcone.

482
00:47:17,712 --> 00:47:20,798
But you know who I'm working for,
and when he gets here...

483
00:47:20,965 --> 00:47:22,884
He... He's coming to Gotham?

484
00:47:23,051 --> 00:47:24,510
Yes, he is.

485
00:47:24,677 --> 00:47:27,138
And when he gets here,
he's not going to wanna hear...

486
00:47:27,305 --> 00:47:32,393
...that you've endangered our operation
just to get your thugs out of jail time.

487
00:47:33,394 --> 00:47:36,731
- Who's bothering you?
- There's a girl at the DA's office.

488
00:47:37,232 --> 00:47:39,025
- We'll buy her off.
- Not this one.

489
00:47:40,151 --> 00:47:42,070
Idealist, huh?

490
00:47:42,237 --> 00:47:43,947
Well, there's an answer to that too.

491
00:47:44,322 --> 00:47:47,283
- I don't want to know.
- Yes, you do.

492
00:47:51,454 --> 00:47:54,916
No, we are showing very healthy growth
in these sectors.

493
00:47:55,083 --> 00:47:58,253
I don't think Thomas Wayne would have
viewed heavy-arms manufacture...

494
00:47:58,419 --> 00:48:00,588
...as a suitable cornerstone
for our business.

495
00:48:01,965 --> 00:48:05,760
Well, that's 20 years ago, Fredericks.

496
00:48:06,094 --> 00:48:09,264
I think after 20 years
we can allow ourselves...

497
00:48:09,430 --> 00:48:12,267
...to stop thinking about what
Thomas Wayne would have done.

498
00:48:12,433 --> 00:48:14,310
Good morning, Mr. Earle's office.

499
00:48:14,477 --> 00:48:17,772
Yes, he's confirmed for
the dinner tomorrow evening.

500
00:48:17,939 --> 00:48:21,276
Good morning.
I'm here to see Mr. Earle.

501
00:48:21,442 --> 00:48:22,944
Name?

502
00:48:23,403 --> 00:48:25,071
Bruce Wayne.

503
00:48:26,948 --> 00:48:30,451
Thomas would probably not
have taken the company public.

504
00:48:30,618 --> 00:48:34,706
But that is what we,
as responsible managers, are going to do.

505
00:48:35,415 --> 00:48:36,958
Jessica?

506
00:48:38,042 --> 00:48:40,587
Jessica? Where are you?

507
00:48:40,753 --> 00:48:45,008
- Eye on the ball, and...
- Why is no one answering the phone?

508
00:48:45,675 --> 00:48:48,845
It's Wayne Enterprises, Mr. Earle.
I'm sure they'll call back.

509
00:48:49,178 --> 00:48:51,681
Bruce? You're supposed to be dead.

510
00:48:51,848 --> 00:48:53,808
I'm sorry to disappoint.

511
00:48:53,975 --> 00:48:56,686
- I need you to take a look at this.
- Have you seen him yet?

512
00:48:56,978 --> 00:48:58,521
- Who?
- Wayne.

513
00:48:58,855 --> 00:49:00,940
It's been all over the news.
He's back.

514
00:49:04,861 --> 00:49:07,780
I'm sure you realize
I can't stop the big machine.

515
00:49:07,947 --> 00:49:09,198
Too many wheels turning.

516
00:49:09,365 --> 00:49:11,367
- We're going public.
- I understand.

517
00:49:11,826 --> 00:49:14,662
And I'll be handsomely rewarded
for my shares.

518
00:49:14,829 --> 00:49:17,373
I'm not looking to interfere.

519
00:49:17,832 --> 00:49:19,959
- I am looking for a job.
- Oh?

520
00:49:20,126 --> 00:49:23,171
I just want to get to know the company
that my family built.

521
00:49:23,504 --> 00:49:25,256
Any ideas where you would start?

522
00:49:25,757 --> 00:49:28,134
Applied Sciences caught my eye.

523
00:49:28,509 --> 00:49:30,219
Fox's department.

524
00:49:30,386 --> 00:49:32,388
I'll let him know you're coming.

525
00:49:33,306 --> 00:49:36,059
You look like him. Your dad.

526
00:49:36,851 --> 00:49:39,520
You're the only one left
of the Wayne family.

527
00:49:39,687 --> 00:49:43,650
This is where you belong.
Welcome home.

528
00:49:43,983 --> 00:49:48,488
Environmental procedures,
defense projects, consumer products.

529
00:49:48,988 --> 00:49:51,699
All prototypes. None in production.

530
00:49:51,866 --> 00:49:54,535
- On any level whatsoever.
- None?

531
00:49:55,536 --> 00:49:57,372
What did they tell you this place was?

532
00:49:57,538 --> 00:49:59,582
They didn't tell me anything.

533
00:50:02,043 --> 00:50:05,505
Earle told me exactly what it was
when he sent me down here.

534
00:50:05,964 --> 00:50:07,423
Dead end.

535
00:50:07,590 --> 00:50:10,927
Place to keep me from causing
the board any more trouble.

536
00:50:11,886 --> 00:50:13,388
Come on.

537
00:50:13,554 --> 00:50:16,015
- You were on the board?
- When your father ran things.

538
00:50:16,182 --> 00:50:18,059
- You knew my father?
- Oh, yeah.

539
00:50:18,226 --> 00:50:19,894
Helped him build his train.

540
00:50:20,478 --> 00:50:22,105
Here we are.

541
00:50:25,775 --> 00:50:27,402
Kevlar utility harness.

542
00:50:27,777 --> 00:50:29,737
Gas-powered, magnetic grapple gun.

543
00:50:29,904 --> 00:50:32,240
The 350-pound test monofilament.

544
00:50:35,577 --> 00:50:37,745
Wonderful project, your dad's train.

545
00:50:38,246 --> 00:50:42,875
Routed it right into Wayne Tower,
along with the water and power utilities.

546
00:50:43,042 --> 00:50:46,254
Kind of made Wayne Tower
the unofficial center of Gotham City.

547
00:50:46,462 --> 00:50:49,090
Of course, Earle let it go to rot.
Here we are.

548
00:50:50,967 --> 00:50:53,094
Nomex survival suit
for advanced infantry.

549
00:50:53,303 --> 00:50:56,055
Kevlar biweave, reinforced joints.

550
00:50:56,389 --> 00:50:58,766
- Tear-resistant?
- This sucker will stop a knife.

551
00:50:58,933 --> 00:51:01,144
- Bulletproof?
- Anything but a straight shot.

552
00:51:01,311 --> 00:51:04,188
- Why didn't they put it into production?
- Bean counters didn't think...

553
00:51:04,355 --> 00:51:06,733
...a soldier's life was worth 300 grand.

554
00:51:07,817 --> 00:51:11,279
So, what's your interest in it,
Mr. Wayne?

555
00:51:11,946 --> 00:51:13,448
I want to borrow it.

556
00:51:13,615 --> 00:51:15,408
For spelunking.

557
00:51:16,284 --> 00:51:17,577
Spelunking?

558
00:51:17,744 --> 00:51:19,454
Yeah, you know, cave diving?

559
00:51:20,747 --> 00:51:23,416
You expecting to run into
much gunfire in these caves?

560
00:51:25,752 --> 00:51:29,005
Look, I'd rather Mr. Earle
didn't know about me borrowing...

561
00:51:29,172 --> 00:51:30,423
Mr. Wayne...

562
00:51:30,632 --> 00:51:32,550
...the way I see it...

563
00:51:33,009 --> 00:51:35,470
...all this stuff is yours anyway.

564
00:51:38,431 --> 00:51:40,934
Okay. Give it a try.

565
00:51:45,063 --> 00:51:46,314
Charming.

566
00:51:49,150 --> 00:51:50,944
At least you'll have company.

567
00:51:52,820 --> 00:51:56,824
This must be the lowest foundation
of the southeast wing.

568
00:52:09,295 --> 00:52:13,466
Your great-great-grandfather was
involved in the Underground Railroad...

569
00:52:13,633 --> 00:52:16,636
...secretly transporting freed slaves
to the North...

570
00:52:16,803 --> 00:52:20,515
...and I suspect these caverns
came in handy.

571
00:52:33,194 --> 00:52:35,363
Alfred! Come up here!

572
00:52:35,572 --> 00:52:38,533
I can see everything all right
from down here, sir, thank you.

573
00:52:58,553 --> 00:53:01,222
We order the main part
of this cowl from Singapore.

574
00:53:01,389 --> 00:53:02,890
Via a dummy corporation.

575
00:53:03,057 --> 00:53:04,892
Indeed. And then, quite separately...

576
00:53:05,059 --> 00:53:10,023
...we place an order
to a Chinese company for these.

577
00:53:10,565 --> 00:53:13,526
- Put it together ourselves.
- Precisely.

578
00:53:13,693 --> 00:53:17,739
They'll have to be large orders,
to avoid suspicion.

579
00:53:17,906 --> 00:53:20,450
- How large?
- Say 10,000.

580
00:53:22,952 --> 00:53:25,872
- Well, at least we'll have spares.
- Yes.

581
00:53:42,972 --> 00:53:45,058
Don't suppose you want a taste.

582
00:53:45,224 --> 00:53:48,394
I just keep offering,
thinking maybe someday you'll get wise.

583
00:53:48,561 --> 00:53:50,730
There's nothing wise
in what you do, Flass.

584
00:53:50,897 --> 00:53:54,275
Well, Jimbo, you don't take the taste,
makes us guys nervous.

585
00:53:54,442 --> 00:53:56,277
I'm no rat.

586
00:53:59,030 --> 00:54:02,742
In a town this bent,
who's there to rat to anyway?

587
00:54:32,438 --> 00:54:34,566
Don't turn around.

588
00:54:35,149 --> 00:54:38,236
You're a good cop.
One of the few.

589
00:54:38,903 --> 00:54:40,029
What do you want?

590
00:54:40,196 --> 00:54:43,366
Carmine Falcone brings in
shipments of drugs every week.

591
00:54:43,533 --> 00:54:45,326
Nobody takes him down. Why?

592
00:54:46,744 --> 00:54:48,871
He's paid up with the right people.

593
00:54:49,163 --> 00:54:51,958
What will it take to bring him down?

594
00:54:52,667 --> 00:54:55,086
Leverage on Judge Faden...

595
00:54:55,795 --> 00:54:58,172
...and a DA brave enough
to prosecute.

596
00:54:58,590 --> 00:55:00,216
Rachel Dawes.

597
00:55:00,800 --> 00:55:01,926
Who are you?

598
00:55:02,343 --> 00:55:03,970
Watch for my sign.

599
00:55:06,639 --> 00:55:08,683
You're just one man?

600
00:55:09,100 --> 00:55:10,518
Now we're two.

601
00:55:12,645 --> 00:55:14,230
We?

602
00:55:29,871 --> 00:55:31,623
Freeze!

603
00:55:48,806 --> 00:55:50,725
What the hell was that?

604
00:55:53,645 --> 00:55:54,854
Just some nut.

605
00:55:58,274 --> 00:56:01,069
Well, what is it today?
More spelunking?

606
00:56:01,236 --> 00:56:03,738
No. Today it's BASE-jumping.

607
00:56:04,322 --> 00:56:05,949
BASE-jumping.

608
00:56:06,532 --> 00:56:09,077
- That like parachuting?
- Kind of.

609
00:56:10,286 --> 00:56:13,081
Do you have any lightweight fabrics?

610
00:56:13,248 --> 00:56:15,917
You know,
I think I have just the thing.

611
00:56:17,252 --> 00:56:19,712
It's called memory cloth.
Notice anything?

612
00:56:23,049 --> 00:56:24,926
Regularly flexible...

613
00:56:25,343 --> 00:56:27,470
...but put a current through it...

614
00:56:28,930 --> 00:56:32,642
...molecules realign, it becomes rigid.
- What kind of shapes can you make?

615
00:56:32,809 --> 00:56:35,937
Can be tailored to fit any structure
based on a rigid skeleton.

616
00:56:36,104 --> 00:56:37,313
Too expensive for the Army?

617
00:56:37,480 --> 00:56:42,235
I don't think they tried to market it
to the billionaire, BASE-jumping crowd.

618
00:56:42,402 --> 00:56:44,195
- Look, Mr. Fox.
- Yes, sir?

619
00:56:44,862 --> 00:56:46,239
If you're uncomfortable...

620
00:56:46,406 --> 00:56:49,617
Mr. Wayne, if you don't want to tell me
exactly what you're doing...

621
00:56:49,784 --> 00:56:51,744
...when I'm asked, I don't have to lie.

622
00:56:53,496 --> 00:56:56,082
But don't think of me as an idiot.

623
00:56:57,584 --> 00:56:59,544
Fair enough.

624
00:57:01,462 --> 00:57:03,298
What's that?

625
00:57:05,383 --> 00:57:07,302
The Tumbler?

626
00:57:07,802 --> 00:57:09,762
Oh, you wouldn't be interested in that.

627
00:57:15,768 --> 00:57:17,687
She was built as a bridging vehicle.

628
00:57:19,689 --> 00:57:24,110
During combat, two of these
would jump over a river, towing cables.

629
00:57:26,654 --> 00:57:30,283
Over here on the throttle,
flip that open and throttle up.

630
00:57:30,491 --> 00:57:33,036
This will boost you into a rampless jump...
Not now!

631
00:57:35,872 --> 00:57:37,999
Not... Not now, sir.

632
00:57:40,835 --> 00:57:42,712
Afterburner disengaged.

633
00:57:43,087 --> 00:57:46,132
We never could get
the damn bridge to work...

634
00:57:46,299 --> 00:57:48,009
...but this baby works just fine.

635
00:57:57,560 --> 00:57:58,811
So, what do you think?

636
00:58:00,063 --> 00:58:02,065
Does it come in black?

637
00:58:02,690 --> 00:58:05,068
I need you at the docks Thursday.

638
00:58:05,318 --> 00:58:07,195
- Problems?
- I don't want any trouble...

639
00:58:07,362 --> 00:58:09,489
...with the last shipment.
- Sure.

640
00:58:11,074 --> 00:58:14,744
Word on the street is you got a beef
with somebody in the DA's office.

641
00:58:14,911 --> 00:58:17,330
- Is that right?
- And that there's a fat prize...

642
00:58:17,497 --> 00:58:20,208
...waiting for anybody willing
to do anything about it.

643
00:58:20,375 --> 00:58:22,335
So, what's your point, Mr. Flass?

644
00:58:22,794 --> 00:58:24,045
Have you seen the girl?

645
00:58:24,545 --> 00:58:27,215
It's a cute little assistant D A.

646
00:58:27,382 --> 00:58:31,052
Don 't you think that's a little too much
heat to bring down, maybe?

647
00:58:31,219 --> 00:58:34,555
- Even for this town.
- Never underestimate Gotham City.

648
00:58:34,722 --> 00:58:37,558
People get mugged coming home
from work every day of the week.

649
00:58:37,725 --> 00:58:40,353
Sometimes...
Sometimes things just go bad.

650
00:58:44,232 --> 00:58:46,025
It's a problem with the graphite, sir.

651
00:58:46,234 --> 00:58:48,903
The next 10,000
will be up to specifications.

652
00:58:49,070 --> 00:58:51,656
- At least they gave us a discount.
- Quite.

653
00:58:51,823 --> 00:58:57,453
In the meantime, sir, may I suggest
you try to avoid landing on your head?

654
00:59:34,449 --> 00:59:36,492
Why bats, Master Wayne?

655
00:59:36,743 --> 00:59:37,994
Bats frighten me.

656
00:59:39,287 --> 00:59:41,581
It's time my enemies shared my dread.

657
01:00:08,274 --> 01:00:10,193
What is this?

658
01:00:13,988 --> 01:00:15,323
Continue.

659
01:00:20,828 --> 01:00:22,497
Looks fine out there.

660
01:00:22,914 --> 01:00:24,832
The bears go straight to the dealers.

661
01:00:24,999 --> 01:00:27,669
Yeah, and the rabbits go
to the man in the Narrows.

662
01:00:27,835 --> 01:00:30,838
- What's the difference?
- Ignorance is bliss, my friend.

663
01:00:31,005 --> 01:00:34,175
Don't burden yourself
with the secrets of scary people.

664
01:00:50,024 --> 01:00:53,027
Hey. Steiss.

665
01:01:14,340 --> 01:01:15,800
Steiss?

666
01:01:27,729 --> 01:01:29,355
What?

667
01:01:30,106 --> 01:01:31,566
What the...?

668
01:01:40,575 --> 01:01:42,410
I better check it.

669
01:01:54,964 --> 01:01:56,966
There's a problem out here.
You better bail.

670
01:02:26,287 --> 01:02:27,914
Where are you?!

671
01:02:28,081 --> 01:02:29,123
Here.

672
01:02:50,186 --> 01:02:53,481
Get going. Oh, shit.

673
01:03:11,666 --> 01:03:13,793
What the hell are you?

674
01:03:16,838 --> 01:03:18,006
I'm Batman.

675
01:03:26,347 --> 01:03:28,308
Nice coat.

676
01:03:30,018 --> 01:03:31,561
Thanks.

677
01:04:12,602 --> 01:04:13,853
Hold it.

678
01:04:15,980 --> 01:04:18,441
That's right, you better run.

679
01:04:27,408 --> 01:04:29,244
Falcone sent them to kill you.

680
01:04:30,370 --> 01:04:32,956
- Why?
- You rattled his cage.

681
01:04:36,751 --> 01:04:38,294
- What's this?
- Leverage.

682
01:04:38,461 --> 01:04:40,088
- For what?
- To get things moving.

683
01:04:40,380 --> 01:04:42,382
Who are you?

684
01:04:42,757 --> 01:04:44,008
Someone like you.

685
01:04:44,175 --> 01:04:46,219
Someone who'll rattle the cages.

686
01:04:51,307 --> 01:04:54,811
Ma'am? Everything okay?

687
01:04:59,107 --> 01:05:01,609
- Falcone's men?
- Does it matter?

688
01:05:01,776 --> 01:05:04,070
We'll never tie him to it anyway.

689
01:05:04,279 --> 01:05:06,406
I wouldn't be too sure of that.

690
01:05:19,460 --> 01:05:21,296
What the hell is that?

691
01:05:30,888 --> 01:05:32,140
Cut him down.

692
01:05:54,746 --> 01:05:55,997
Unacceptable.

693
01:05:56,164 --> 01:05:59,000
Now, I don't care if it's rival gangs,
Guardian Angels...

694
01:05:59,167 --> 01:06:01,127
...or the goddamn Salvation Army...

695
01:06:01,377 --> 01:06:03,713
...get them off the street
and off the front page.

696
01:06:03,880 --> 01:06:06,466
They say it was just one guy.
Or a creature.

697
01:06:06,633 --> 01:06:09,344
It was some asshole in a costume.

698
01:06:09,844 --> 01:06:11,512
- Yeah?
- This guy did deliver us...

699
01:06:11,679 --> 01:06:14,474
...one of the city's biggest crime lords.

700
01:06:14,641 --> 01:06:18,144
No one takes the law
into their own hands in my city.

701
01:06:18,311 --> 01:06:19,520
Understand?

702
01:06:19,812 --> 01:06:22,273
- No way to bury it now.
- There's still Judge Faden.

703
01:06:22,440 --> 01:06:25,526
- I've got Faden covered.
- What about this bat they babble about?

704
01:06:25,693 --> 01:06:28,821
Even if these guys will swear
to being thrashed by a giant bat...

705
01:06:28,988 --> 01:06:31,157
...we've got Falcone at the scene.

706
01:06:31,324 --> 01:06:34,535
Drugs, prints, cargo manifests.
This bat character gave us everything.

707
01:06:34,953 --> 01:06:36,496
Okay. Let's do it.

708
01:06:39,916 --> 01:06:42,043
- Bats are nocturnal.
- Bats may be.

709
01:06:42,210 --> 01:06:45,630
But even for billionaire playboys,
3:00 is pushing it.

710
01:06:46,673 --> 01:06:49,550
The price for leading a double life,
I fear.

711
01:06:50,885 --> 01:06:53,304
Your theatrics made an impression.

712
01:06:54,681 --> 01:06:57,725
Theatricality and deception...

713
01:06:57,892 --> 01:07:01,104
...are powerful weapons, Alfred.
This is a good start.

714
01:07:01,271 --> 01:07:04,065
If those are to be the first
of many injuries to come...

715
01:07:04,232 --> 01:07:07,068
...it would be wise
to find a suitable excuse.

716
01:07:07,402 --> 01:07:08,736
Polo, for instance.

717
01:07:08,903 --> 01:07:10,572
I'm not learning polo, Alfred.

718
01:07:10,822 --> 01:07:14,492
Strange injuries,
a nonexistent social life.

719
01:07:14,659 --> 01:07:16,119
These things beg the question...

720
01:07:16,286 --> 01:07:20,540
...as to what exactly does Bruce Wayne
do with his time and his money.

721
01:07:20,707 --> 01:07:22,292
What does someone like me do?

722
01:07:23,251 --> 01:07:27,463
Drive sports cars, date movie stars.

723
01:07:28,131 --> 01:07:29,716
Buy things that are not for sale.

724
01:07:29,882 --> 01:07:33,428
Who knows, Master Wayne,
you start pretending to have fun...

725
01:07:34,053 --> 01:07:36,055
...you might even have a little
by accident.

726
01:07:38,766 --> 01:07:40,226
Sir.

727
01:07:40,393 --> 01:07:42,729
- We have a situation.
- All right.

728
01:07:43,104 --> 01:07:46,941
The Coast Guard picked up
one of our cargo ships last night...

729
01:07:47,483 --> 01:07:52,280
...heavily damaged, all crew missing,
probably dead.

730
01:07:54,324 --> 01:07:56,701
The ship was carrying
a prototype weapon.

731
01:07:56,910 --> 01:07:58,703
It's a microwave emitter.

732
01:07:58,870 --> 01:08:01,831
It's designed for desert warfare,
but it...

733
01:08:03,499 --> 01:08:05,084
It looks like somebody...

734
01:08:09,464 --> 01:08:10,965
...turned it on.

735
01:08:15,136 --> 01:08:19,599
It uses focused microwaves to
vaporize the enemy's water supply.

736
01:08:27,523 --> 01:08:30,485
The damage to the ship
was catastrophic.

737
01:08:30,652 --> 01:08:33,655
The weapon itself is...

738
01:08:34,948 --> 01:08:36,449
Missing?

739
01:08:37,283 --> 01:08:38,534
Yeah.

740
01:08:39,827 --> 01:08:41,788
Mr. Wayne.

741
01:08:45,500 --> 01:08:46,960
Nice car.

742
01:08:47,126 --> 01:08:48,503
You should see my other one.

743
01:08:58,513 --> 01:09:00,473
He's done something
the police never have.

744
01:09:00,640 --> 01:09:02,934
You can't take the law
into your own hands.

745
01:09:03,101 --> 01:09:05,687
Well, at least he's getting
something done.

746
01:09:05,853 --> 01:09:08,189
Bruce, help me out here.

747
01:09:08,356 --> 01:09:12,694
Well, a guy who dresses up
like a bat clearly has issues.

748
01:09:13,736 --> 01:09:15,989
But he's put Falcone behind bars.

749
01:09:16,155 --> 01:09:18,533
And now the cops want him.
What does that tell you?

750
01:09:18,700 --> 01:09:19,909
They're jealous.

751
01:09:20,076 --> 01:09:22,704
Sir, the pool is for decoration...

752
01:09:22,870 --> 01:09:26,249
...and your friends
do not have swimwear.

753
01:09:28,042 --> 01:09:30,044
Well, they're European.

754
01:09:31,879 --> 01:09:34,257
I'm going to have to ask you to leave.

755
01:09:35,174 --> 01:09:38,636
- It is not a question of money.
- Well, you see...

756
01:09:39,220 --> 01:09:41,014
...I'm buying this hotel...

757
01:09:42,807 --> 01:09:47,228
...and setting some new rules
about the pool area.

758
01:09:48,396 --> 01:09:50,773
I think the Batman deserves a medal.

759
01:09:50,940 --> 01:09:53,067
And a straitjacket to pin it on.

760
01:09:59,574 --> 01:10:01,159
Thank you.

761
01:10:02,911 --> 01:10:04,245
Bruce?

762
01:10:07,832 --> 01:10:09,626
Rachel?

763
01:10:09,792 --> 01:10:11,210
I'd heard you were back.

764
01:10:13,254 --> 01:10:14,756
What are you doing?

765
01:10:15,506 --> 01:10:19,928
Just swimming here.
Wow, it is good to see you.

766
01:10:20,094 --> 01:10:21,638
You were gone a long time.

767
01:10:22,222 --> 01:10:25,141
- I know. How are things?
- The same.

768
01:10:27,060 --> 01:10:28,728
Job's getting worse.

769
01:10:28,895 --> 01:10:31,606
Can't change the world on your own.

770
01:10:31,773 --> 01:10:33,858
What choice do I have...

771
01:10:34,525 --> 01:10:36,277
...when you're too busy swimming?

772
01:10:37,612 --> 01:10:39,656
Rachel, all of...

773
01:10:39,948 --> 01:10:41,616
All this...

774
01:10:43,034 --> 01:10:47,080
It's... It's not me. It's...

775
01:10:47,497 --> 01:10:50,124
Inside, I am...

776
01:10:51,334 --> 01:10:53,294
I am more.

777
01:10:53,962 --> 01:10:55,505
Come on, Bruce. Come on.

778
01:10:55,672 --> 01:10:59,467
Bruce, we have some more hotels
for you to buy.

779
01:11:00,510 --> 01:11:01,970
Bruce...

780
01:11:03,137 --> 01:11:06,641
...deep down you may still be
that same great kid you used to be.

781
01:11:09,060 --> 01:11:11,646
But it's not who you are underneath...

782
01:11:12,105 --> 01:11:13,856
...it's what you do that defines you.

783
01:11:26,411 --> 01:11:27,996
Dr. Crane, thanks for coming.

784
01:11:28,162 --> 01:11:31,040
Not at all. He cut his wrists?

785
01:11:31,207 --> 01:11:34,877
Probably looking for the insanity plea.
But if anything should happen...

786
01:11:35,044 --> 01:11:38,006
Of course, better safe than sorry.

787
01:11:41,426 --> 01:11:45,013
Yeah, Dr. Crane, I can't take it anymore.
It's all too much.

788
01:11:45,179 --> 01:11:47,640
The walls are closing in.
Blah, blah, blah.

789
01:11:48,182 --> 01:11:50,685
A couple of days of this food,
it'll be true.

790
01:11:51,686 --> 01:11:53,354
- What do you want?
- I wanna know...

791
01:11:53,521 --> 01:11:56,024
...how you're gonna convince me
to keep my mouth shut.

792
01:11:56,190 --> 01:11:58,359
About what?
You don't know anything.

793
01:11:58,526 --> 01:12:02,697
I know you don't want the cops to take
a closer look at the drugs they seized.

794
01:12:02,864 --> 01:12:07,035
And I know about your experiments
with the inmates of your nut house.

795
01:12:07,201 --> 01:12:10,872
See, I don't go into business with a guy
without finding out his dirty secrets.

796
01:12:11,456 --> 01:12:14,375
And those goons you used.

797
01:12:14,542 --> 01:12:16,377
I own the muscle in this town.

798
01:12:16,544 --> 01:12:19,923
Now, I've been bringing
your stuff in for months...

799
01:12:20,465 --> 01:12:24,677
...so whatever he's planning,
it's big, and I want in.

800
01:12:25,970 --> 01:12:29,098
Well, I already know what he'll say.

801
01:12:29,515 --> 01:12:30,892
That we should kill you.

802
01:12:32,769 --> 01:12:36,064
Even he can't get me in here.
Not in my town.

803
01:12:42,028 --> 01:12:43,571
Would you like to see my mask?

804
01:12:45,114 --> 01:12:46,574
I use it in my experiments.

805
01:12:49,077 --> 01:12:53,539
Now, I'm probably not very frightening
to a guy like you.

806
01:12:53,915 --> 01:12:56,751
But these crazies, they can't stand it.

807
01:12:57,669 --> 01:12:59,629
So when did the nut
take over the nut house?

808
01:13:00,588 --> 01:13:03,258
They scream and they cry...

809
01:13:04,259 --> 01:13:05,885
...much as you're doing now.

810
01:13:08,221 --> 01:13:11,432
Well, he's not faking. Not that one.

811
01:13:11,599 --> 01:13:14,143
I'll talk to the judge
and see if I can get him moved...

812
01:13:14,310 --> 01:13:17,730
...to the secure wing at Arkham.
I can't treat him here.

813
01:13:39,752 --> 01:13:41,254
Storm's coming.

814
01:13:45,842 --> 01:13:48,845
The scum is getting jumpy
because you stood up to Falcone.

815
01:13:49,012 --> 01:13:52,557
It's a start. Your partner
was at the docks with Falcone.

816
01:13:52,724 --> 01:13:55,435
Well, he moonlights
as a low-level enforcer.

817
01:13:55,810 --> 01:13:59,606
They were splitting the shipment in two.
Only half went to the dealers.

818
01:13:59,772 --> 01:14:01,691
Why? What about the other half?

819
01:14:02,150 --> 01:14:04,569
- Flass knows.
- He won't talk.

820
01:14:05,194 --> 01:14:06,779
He'll talk to me.

821
01:14:06,946 --> 01:14:09,991
Commissioner Loeb set up
a massive task force to catch you.

822
01:14:10,450 --> 01:14:12,994
- He thinks you're dangerous.
- What do you think?

823
01:14:14,746 --> 01:14:17,165
I think you're trying to help.

824
01:14:22,170 --> 01:14:24,505
But I've been wrong before.

825
01:14:30,303 --> 01:14:32,013
Come on, I ain't got all night.

826
01:14:35,350 --> 01:14:37,185
Flass, I have kids to feed.

827
01:14:37,644 --> 01:14:39,812
What, they don't like falafel?

828
01:14:55,203 --> 01:14:56,913
Where were the other drugs going?

829
01:14:58,206 --> 01:15:00,375
I never knew. I don't know.

830
01:15:00,541 --> 01:15:02,752
- I swear to God.
- Swear to me!

831
01:15:08,383 --> 01:15:11,386
I don't... I don't know.
I never knew. Never.

832
01:15:11,678 --> 01:15:15,139
They went to some guy for a couple days
before they went to the dealers.

833
01:15:15,306 --> 01:15:16,599
Why?

834
01:15:17,267 --> 01:15:20,853
There was something...
Something else in the drugs...

835
01:15:21,020 --> 01:15:22,605
...something hidden.
- What?

836
01:15:22,772 --> 01:15:26,109
I never went to the drop-off point.
It was in the Narrows.

837
01:15:26,276 --> 01:15:29,571
- Cops only go there in force.
- Do I look like a cop?

838
01:15:29,737 --> 01:15:31,531
No...

839
01:15:45,128 --> 01:15:47,171
This is the one I'm talking about.

840
01:15:47,463 --> 01:15:49,757
- What's your problem with it?
- It shouldn't exist.

841
01:15:49,924 --> 01:15:53,761
This ship left Singapore with
246 containers, but arrived with 247.

842
01:15:53,928 --> 01:15:56,306
I'm guessing there's something
I'm not supposed to find in there.

843
01:15:56,472 --> 01:15:59,893
Listen, counselor, we don't wanna
know what's in Mr. Falcone's crate.

844
01:16:00,059 --> 01:16:03,396
Things are working a little
differently now. Open it up.

845
01:16:12,989 --> 01:16:14,240
What the hell is this?

846
01:16:56,824 --> 01:16:59,994
It's you, isn't it?
Everybody's been talking about you.

847
01:17:00,578 --> 01:17:02,330
Get in here!

848
01:17:02,956 --> 01:17:05,083
The other kids won't believe me.

849
01:17:28,189 --> 01:17:30,316
Get rid of all traces.

850
01:17:30,608 --> 01:17:33,528
- Better torch the whole place.
- All right.

851
01:18:09,564 --> 01:18:11,357
Having trouble?

852
01:18:12,066 --> 01:18:14,402
Take a seat. Have a drink.

853
01:18:15,111 --> 01:18:18,364
You look like a man
who takes himself too seriously.

854
01:18:22,076 --> 01:18:25,079
Do you want my opinion?
You need to lighten up.

855
01:19:17,048 --> 01:19:20,760
Alfred, help me.

856
01:19:30,645 --> 01:19:34,023
Blood. Take. Take poison.
Blood poison.

857
01:19:34,190 --> 01:19:37,193
Poisonous. Poisonous.

858
01:19:41,489 --> 01:19:43,199
Bruce...

859
01:19:44,492 --> 01:19:45,660
...why do we fall?

860
01:19:57,755 --> 01:20:01,050
- How long was I out?
- Two days.

861
01:20:01,467 --> 01:20:03,303
It's your birthday.

862
01:20:04,637 --> 01:20:05,889
Many happy returns.

863
01:20:11,102 --> 01:20:14,898
I've felt these effects before,
but this was so much more potent.

864
01:20:15,106 --> 01:20:19,652
It was some kind of hallucinogen,
weaponized, in aerosol form.

865
01:20:19,861 --> 01:20:22,780
You have been hanging out
in the wrong clubs, Mr. Wayne.

866
01:20:22,989 --> 01:20:26,034
I called Mr. Fox when your condition
worsened after the first day.

867
01:20:26,242 --> 01:20:27,577
I analyzed your blood...

868
01:20:27,785 --> 01:20:31,247
...isolating the receptor compounds
and the protein-based catalyst.

869
01:20:31,456 --> 01:20:33,207
Am I meant to understand any of that?

870
01:20:33,625 --> 01:20:36,753
Not at all. I just wanted you to know
how hard it was.

871
01:20:37,378 --> 01:20:41,049
- Bottom line, I synthesized an antidote.
- Could you make more?

872
01:20:41,257 --> 01:20:43,801
You planning on gassing yourself
again, Mr. Wayne?

873
01:20:44,010 --> 01:20:47,180
Well, you know how it is.
You're out at night, looking for kicks...

874
01:20:47,388 --> 01:20:50,141
...someone's passing around
the weaponized hallucinogens...

875
01:20:50,308 --> 01:20:53,728
I'll bring what I have.
The antidote should inoculate you for now.

876
01:20:53,937 --> 01:20:56,272
Alfred, always a pleasure.

877
01:20:56,481 --> 01:20:58,107
Lucius.

878
01:21:02,654 --> 01:21:05,323
- You sure you don't want to come in?
- I have to get back.

879
01:21:05,490 --> 01:21:07,158
- I wanted to leave this.
- Thank you.

880
01:21:07,367 --> 01:21:08,701
Rachel?

881
01:21:10,119 --> 01:21:13,289
Looks like someone's been
burning the candle at both ends.

882
01:21:13,498 --> 01:21:16,167
- Must've been quite an occasion.
- It is my birthday.

883
01:21:16,376 --> 01:21:20,004
I know. I'm sorry I can't come tonight.
I was just dropping off your present.

884
01:21:20,213 --> 01:21:23,633
- You've got better plans?
- My boss has been missing for days...

885
01:21:23,841 --> 01:21:27,512
...which means I should probably start
by looking at the bottom of the river.

886
01:21:27,720 --> 01:21:29,180
- Rachel.
- Excuse me.

887
01:21:32,100 --> 01:21:33,309
Rachel Dawes.

888
01:21:33,935 --> 01:21:37,522
Who authorized that? Get Crane down
there now. Don't take no for an answer.

889
01:21:37,730 --> 01:21:41,568
Call Dr. Lehmann, tell him we need our
own assessment to the judge by morning.

890
01:21:42,026 --> 01:21:43,820
- What's wrong?
- It's Falcone.

891
01:21:44,028 --> 01:21:46,489
Dr. Crane moved him to Arkham Asylum
on suicide watch.

892
01:21:46,698 --> 01:21:49,659
You're going to Arkham now?
It's in the Narrows, Rachel.

893
01:21:50,952 --> 01:21:52,745
You enjoy your party, Bruce.

894
01:21:52,954 --> 01:21:55,665
- Some of us have work to do.
- You be careful.

895
01:21:57,458 --> 01:21:59,002
Happy birthday.

896
01:22:18,438 --> 01:22:20,523
But, Master Wayne,
the guests will be arriving.

897
01:22:20,732 --> 01:22:22,317
Keep them happy until I arrive.

898
01:22:22,525 --> 01:22:24,694
Tell them that joke you know.

899
01:23:03,566 --> 01:23:05,235
Having fun?

900
01:23:07,403 --> 01:23:10,949
Bill? Now, what's a big shot like you
doing in a place like this?

901
01:23:11,157 --> 01:23:12,408
I need some information.

902
01:23:12,617 --> 01:23:17,372
The Wayne Enterprise 47-B, 1 -ME.

903
01:23:18,706 --> 01:23:20,166
1 -ME.

904
01:23:20,375 --> 01:23:24,087
It's a microwave emitter. It was designed
to vaporize an enemy's water supply.

905
01:23:24,295 --> 01:23:28,508
Rumor was they tested dispersing
water-based chemicals into the air...

906
01:23:28,675 --> 01:23:30,593
...but isn't that illegal?

907
01:23:32,345 --> 01:23:36,558
I want all the information
on the development of this project...

908
01:23:36,766 --> 01:23:40,728
...all data, files, backup disks,
on my desk right away.

909
01:23:41,145 --> 01:23:42,772
Did you lose one?

910
01:23:43,856 --> 01:23:47,443
I'm merging your department
with Archives.

911
01:23:48,695 --> 01:23:49,946
And I am firing you.

912
01:23:52,115 --> 01:23:54,075
Didn't you get the memo?

913
01:24:01,332 --> 01:24:02,959
Scarecrow.

914
01:24:06,296 --> 01:24:08,131
Scarecrow.

915
01:24:11,509 --> 01:24:12,802
Scarecrow.

916
01:24:15,847 --> 01:24:18,016
Miss Dawes, this is most irregular.

917
01:24:18,224 --> 01:24:21,102
I have nothing to add
to the report I filed with the judge.

918
01:24:21,311 --> 01:24:23,521
- I have questions about your report.
- Such as?

919
01:24:23,730 --> 01:24:27,984
Isn't it convenient for a 52-year-old man
who has no history of mental illness...

920
01:24:28,192 --> 01:24:31,779
...to have a psychotic breakdown
just when he's about to be indicted?

921
01:24:31,988 --> 01:24:36,200
As you can see for yourself, there is
nothing convenient about his symptoms.

922
01:24:40,872 --> 01:24:42,248
- Scarecrow.
- What's "scarecrow"?

923
01:24:42,749 --> 01:24:46,336
Patients suffering delusional episodes
often focus their paranoia...

924
01:24:46,544 --> 01:24:48,630
...on an external tormentor...

925
01:24:48,838 --> 01:24:52,008
...usually one conforming
to Jungian archetypes.

926
01:24:52,258 --> 01:24:54,636
In this case, a scarecrow.

927
01:24:56,137 --> 01:25:00,266
- He's drugged?
- Psychopharmacology is my primary field.

928
01:25:00,433 --> 01:25:01,809
I'm a strong advocate.

929
01:25:02,727 --> 01:25:04,896
Outside, he was a giant.

930
01:25:05,104 --> 01:25:07,523
In here, only the mind
can grant you power.

931
01:25:07,732 --> 01:25:09,442
You enjoy the reversal.

932
01:25:09,651 --> 01:25:12,612
I respect the mind's power
over the body.

933
01:25:12,820 --> 01:25:14,364
It's why I do what I do.

934
01:25:14,530 --> 01:25:19,410
I do what I do to keep thugs like Falcone
behind bars, not in therapy.

935
01:25:19,619 --> 01:25:22,872
I want my own psychiatric consultant
to have full access to Falcone...

936
01:25:23,081 --> 01:25:26,376
...including blood work.
Find out what exactly you put him on.

937
01:25:26,584 --> 01:25:29,045
- First thing tomorrow, then.
- Tonight.

938
01:25:29,254 --> 01:25:32,674
I've already paged Dr. Lehmann
at County General.

939
01:25:34,092 --> 01:25:35,885
As you wish.

940
01:25:41,432 --> 01:25:43,351
This way, please.

941
01:25:43,560 --> 01:25:46,145
There's something
I think you should see.

942
01:25:57,073 --> 01:25:59,659
This is where we make the medicine.

943
01:26:06,499 --> 01:26:10,378
Perhaps you should have some,
clear your head.

944
01:26:35,653 --> 01:26:37,238
Who knows you're here?

945
01:26:38,323 --> 01:26:39,908
Who knows?

946
01:26:47,165 --> 01:26:48,374
He's here.

947
01:26:48,583 --> 01:26:49,792
Who?

948
01:26:50,001 --> 01:26:51,920
The Batman.

949
01:26:53,755 --> 01:26:55,632
- What do we do?
- What anyone does...

950
01:26:55,840 --> 01:26:58,593
...when a prowler comes around.

951
01:26:59,552 --> 01:27:02,096
- Call the police.
- You want the cops here?

952
01:27:02,680 --> 01:27:05,433
At this point, they can't stop us.

953
01:27:05,642 --> 01:27:09,145
But the Batman
has a talent for disruption.

954
01:27:09,354 --> 01:27:12,523
Force him outside,
the police will take him down. Go.

955
01:27:12,732 --> 01:27:14,817
- What about her?
- She hasn't got long.

956
01:27:15,026 --> 01:27:16,945
I gave her a concentrated dose.

957
01:27:17,153 --> 01:27:19,697
The mind can only take so much.
Now go.

958
01:27:22,242 --> 01:27:24,494
The things they say about him.

959
01:27:24,702 --> 01:27:26,246
Can he really fly?

960
01:27:26,412 --> 01:27:28,456
I heard he can disappear.

961
01:27:28,665 --> 01:27:31,668
Well, we'll find out.

962
01:27:31,960 --> 01:27:33,586
Won't we?

963
01:28:20,925 --> 01:28:23,052
Taste of your own medicine, doctor?

964
01:28:29,726 --> 01:28:31,561
What have you been doing here?

965
01:28:34,689 --> 01:28:37,066
Who are you working for?

966
01:28:41,529 --> 01:28:43,865
Ra's... Ra's al Ghul.

967
01:28:44,073 --> 01:28:48,912
Ra's al Ghul is dead.
Who are you working for?

968
01:28:49,120 --> 01:28:50,121
Crane.

969
01:28:52,624 --> 01:28:55,543
Dr. Crane isn't here right now.

970
01:28:56,127 --> 01:28:58,004
But if you'd like to make
an appointment...

971
01:29:11,059 --> 01:29:13,937
Batman, put down your weapons
and surrender.

972
01:29:14,687 --> 01:29:16,064
You're surrounded.

973
01:29:21,653 --> 01:29:24,405
- What are you waiting for?
- Backup.

974
01:29:25,156 --> 01:29:27,533
- Backup?
- The Batman's in there.

975
01:29:27,742 --> 01:29:29,869
SWAT's on the way.
But if you wanna go in now...

976
01:29:30,078 --> 01:29:31,621
...I'll be right behind you, sir.

977
01:29:33,122 --> 01:29:34,624
SWAT's on the way.

978
01:29:35,750 --> 01:29:37,001
- Hey.
- Hey.

979
01:30:19,544 --> 01:30:21,212
What's happened to her?

980
01:30:23,923 --> 01:30:27,677
Crane poisoned her with a psychotropic
hallucinogen, a panic-inducing toxin.

981
01:30:29,721 --> 01:30:33,433
- Let me get her down to the medics.
- They can't help her, but I can.

982
01:30:37,395 --> 01:30:39,522
Get her downstairs.
Meet me in the alley.

983
01:30:47,530 --> 01:30:50,366
Crane's been smuggling his toxin
hidden in Falcone's drugs...

984
01:30:50,575 --> 01:30:52,702
...and they're dumping it
into the water supply.

985
01:30:53,244 --> 01:30:54,871
- What was he planning?
- I don't know.

986
01:30:55,121 --> 01:30:56,414
Was he working for Falcone?

987
01:30:56,915 --> 01:30:59,417
He mentioned someone else,
someone worse.

988
01:30:59,626 --> 01:31:02,170
She needs the antidote
before the damage is permanent.

989
01:31:02,378 --> 01:31:04,547
- How long does she have?
- Not long.

990
01:31:08,468 --> 01:31:10,220
What is that?

991
01:31:11,638 --> 01:31:13,890
- Backup.
- What the...?

992
01:32:32,135 --> 01:32:33,636
Excuse me.

993
01:32:38,433 --> 01:32:41,644
- How is she?
- She's fading. We gotta go.

994
01:32:43,521 --> 01:32:44,981
I'll get my car.

995
01:32:45,148 --> 01:32:46,941
I brought mine.

996
01:32:47,358 --> 01:32:48,985
Yours?

997
01:32:58,328 --> 01:33:00,121
I've gotta get me one of those.

998
01:33:01,372 --> 01:33:03,499
- He is in a vehicle.
- Make and color?

999
01:33:03,708 --> 01:33:06,044
It's a black...

1000
01:33:07,378 --> 01:33:08,671
...tank.

1001
01:33:11,341 --> 01:33:12,675
Stay calm.

1002
01:33:13,384 --> 01:33:15,136
You've been poisoned.

1003
01:33:17,889 --> 01:33:19,182
I'm on him.

1004
01:33:27,607 --> 01:33:28,650
Breathe slowly.

1005
01:33:38,785 --> 01:33:39,869
Hold on.

1006
01:33:54,384 --> 01:33:55,718
- What are you doing?
- Shortcut.

1007
01:34:04,269 --> 01:34:06,020
Air One to ground, block that ramp.

1008
01:34:10,608 --> 01:34:12,193
He's got no way off that roof.

1009
01:34:13,611 --> 01:34:16,698
Turn off your engine.
Step away from the car.

1010
01:34:19,075 --> 01:34:21,828
- Trust me.
- Weapons system activated.

1011
01:34:39,762 --> 01:34:41,014
Who is this guy?

1012
01:34:41,347 --> 01:34:43,057
- Where's he going?
- He's on the roof.

1013
01:34:57,488 --> 01:34:59,657
- What street is he taking?
- He's not on a street.

1014
01:34:59,866 --> 01:35:01,576
He's flying on rooftops.

1015
01:35:40,823 --> 01:35:43,034
At least tell me what it looks like.

1016
01:35:46,079 --> 01:35:47,497
Never mind.

1017
01:35:51,417 --> 01:35:52,752
Got him.

1018
01:36:03,680 --> 01:36:05,223
Coming right up on his butt.

1019
01:36:29,956 --> 01:36:32,375
We're tracking suspect vehicle
heading west on I- 17.

1020
01:36:37,672 --> 01:36:39,340
- Air One to ground.
- I lost him.

1021
01:36:39,549 --> 01:36:41,384
We've lost visual. Exit 9 is blocked.

1022
01:36:41,593 --> 01:36:43,553
We'll loop back to check
the frontage road.

1023
01:36:43,761 --> 01:36:45,847
Stealth mode activated.

1024
01:36:46,514 --> 01:36:47,724
Stay with me.

1025
01:36:53,938 --> 01:36:55,398
What...? There he is.

1026
01:37:15,126 --> 01:37:16,586
Just hold on.

1027
01:37:20,548 --> 01:37:21,716
Rachel!

1028
01:37:54,499 --> 01:37:56,834
- They get any of this into the mains?
- Yeah.

1029
01:37:57,043 --> 01:37:59,879
Notify the water company.
There's gotta be a way to isolate it.

1030
01:38:00,088 --> 01:38:02,924
No. They put it all in.
They must've been at this for weeks.

1031
01:38:03,132 --> 01:38:06,678
- Gotham's entire water supply is laced.
- Why haven't we felt the effects?

1032
01:38:06,886 --> 01:38:09,138
Must be a compound that has
to be absorbed through the lungs.

1033
01:38:19,399 --> 01:38:21,067
How do you feel?

1034
01:38:23,861 --> 01:38:25,321
Where are we?

1035
01:38:25,863 --> 01:38:29,617
- Why did you bring me here?
- If I hadn't, your mind would be lost.

1036
01:38:29,826 --> 01:38:31,828
- You were poisoned.
- It was...

1037
01:38:32,036 --> 01:38:35,623
- It was Dr. Crane.
- Rest. Gordon has Crane.

1038
01:38:35,832 --> 01:38:37,917
Is Sergeant Gordon your friend?

1039
01:38:38,793 --> 01:38:40,420
I don't have the luxury of friends.

1040
01:38:41,337 --> 01:38:44,632
I'm gonna give you a sedative.
You'll wake up back at home.

1041
01:38:44,841 --> 01:38:48,761
When you do, get these to Gordon,
and Gordon alone. Trust no one.

1042
01:38:48,970 --> 01:38:50,680
- What are they?
- The antidote.

1043
01:38:50,889 --> 01:38:54,183
One for Gordon to inoculate himself,
the other for mass production.

1044
01:38:54,601 --> 01:38:55,852
Mass production?

1045
01:38:56,060 --> 01:38:59,188
Crane was just a pawn.
We need to be ready.

1046
01:39:25,173 --> 01:39:28,551
When you told me your grand plan
for saving Gotham...

1047
01:39:28,760 --> 01:39:31,638
...all that stopped me
from calling the men in white coats...

1048
01:39:31,846 --> 01:39:34,307
...was when you said
it wasn't about thrill-seeking.

1049
01:39:34,515 --> 01:39:37,518
- It's not.
- What would you call that?

1050
01:39:39,395 --> 01:39:42,065
- Damn good television.
- It's a miracle no one was killed.

1051
01:39:42,273 --> 01:39:45,902
I didn't have time to observe
the rules of the road, Alfred.

1052
01:39:46,110 --> 01:39:49,197
You're getting lost inside
this monster of yours.

1053
01:39:49,405 --> 01:39:53,785
I'm using this monster to help
other people, just like my father did.

1054
01:39:53,993 --> 01:39:55,536
For Thomas Wayne, helping others...

1055
01:39:55,745 --> 01:39:58,623
...wasn't about proving anything
to anyone, including himself.

1056
01:39:59,123 --> 01:40:02,460
It's Rachel, Alfred. She was dying.

1057
01:40:02,919 --> 01:40:05,505
She's downstairs, sedated.
I need you to take her home.

1058
01:40:05,838 --> 01:40:09,425
Well, we both care for Rachel, but what
you're doing has to be beyond that.

1059
01:40:09,759 --> 01:40:12,637
It can't be personal,
or you're just a vigilante.

1060
01:40:12,845 --> 01:40:14,681
- Is Fox still here?
- Yes, sir.

1061
01:40:14,889 --> 01:40:16,516
We need to send these people away.

1062
01:40:16,724 --> 01:40:19,644
Those are Bruce Wayne's guests.
You have a name to maintain.

1063
01:40:19,852 --> 01:40:21,646
I don't care about my name.

1064
01:40:21,854 --> 01:40:24,983
It's not just your name, sir.
It's your father's name.

1065
01:40:26,776 --> 01:40:29,112
And it's all that's left of him.

1066
01:40:31,072 --> 01:40:32,615
Don't destroy it.

1067
01:40:47,964 --> 01:40:50,091
- Mr. Earle.
- Happy birthday, Bruce.

1068
01:40:50,300 --> 01:40:51,676
Thank you.

1069
01:40:52,010 --> 01:40:54,012
How did the stock offering go?

1070
01:40:54,304 --> 01:40:55,471
Prices soared.

1071
01:40:55,680 --> 01:40:56,890
Who was buying?

1072
01:40:57,098 --> 01:40:58,975
All kinds of funds and brokerages.

1073
01:40:59,183 --> 01:41:00,852
It's a bit technical.

1074
01:41:01,060 --> 01:41:02,729
The key thing is...

1075
01:41:02,937 --> 01:41:04,898
...our company's future is secure.

1076
01:41:06,774 --> 01:41:07,775
Great.

1077
01:41:21,497 --> 01:41:23,791
A little the worse for wear, I'm afraid.

1078
01:41:29,547 --> 01:41:31,299
What was the plan, Crane?

1079
01:41:31,507 --> 01:41:33,718
How were you gonna get
your toxin into the air?

1080
01:41:34,135 --> 01:41:37,388
Scarecrow. Scarecrow.

1081
01:41:37,597 --> 01:41:39,390
Who were you working for, Crane?

1082
01:41:41,517 --> 01:41:43,686
Oh, it's too late.

1083
01:41:44,312 --> 01:41:46,397
You can't stop it now.

1084
01:41:51,486 --> 01:41:53,029
Here.

1085
01:41:53,196 --> 01:41:55,156
- Happy birthday, Bruce.
- Thank you. Thanks.

1086
01:41:55,365 --> 01:41:58,243
And thank you for that item.

1087
01:41:59,786 --> 01:42:00,995
You're welcome.

1088
01:42:01,204 --> 01:42:03,957
- I know you'll put it to good use.
- I already have.

1089
01:42:04,249 --> 01:42:08,044
How long would it take
to manufacture on a large scale?

1090
01:42:08,628 --> 01:42:09,712
Weeks. Why?

1091
01:42:09,921 --> 01:42:13,049
Somebody's planning to disperse
the toxin using the water supply.

1092
01:42:14,092 --> 01:42:17,136
The water supply won't help you
disperse an inhalant.

1093
01:42:18,096 --> 01:42:19,472
What?

1094
01:42:19,681 --> 01:42:22,183
Unless you have a microwave emitter
powerful enough...

1095
01:42:22,392 --> 01:42:25,228
...to vaporize all the water
in the mains.

1096
01:42:25,687 --> 01:42:28,940
A microwave emitter like the one
Wayne Enterprises just misplaced.

1097
01:42:29,399 --> 01:42:30,567
Misplaced?

1098
01:42:30,775 --> 01:42:34,237
Earle just fired me for asking
too many questions about it.

1099
01:42:36,281 --> 01:42:39,742
Go back to Wayne Enterprises now
and start making more of that antidote.

1100
01:42:39,951 --> 01:42:43,037
The police are gonna need as much
as they can get their hands on.

1101
01:42:43,246 --> 01:42:45,290
My security clearance
has been revoked.

1102
01:42:45,498 --> 01:42:47,458
That wouldn't stop a man like you,
would it?

1103
01:42:47,917 --> 01:42:49,586
I suppose not.

1104
01:42:51,671 --> 01:42:56,301
- Bruce, there's somebody you must meet.
- Not now, Mrs. Delane.

1105
01:42:56,509 --> 01:42:59,345
Now, am I pronouncing this right...

1106
01:42:59,554 --> 01:43:01,973
...Mr. Ra's al Ghul?

1107
01:43:07,645 --> 01:43:09,397
You're not Ra's al Ghul.

1108
01:43:10,982 --> 01:43:12,233
I watched him die.

1109
01:43:12,442 --> 01:43:15,445
But is Ra's al Ghul immortal?

1110
01:43:18,239 --> 01:43:20,658
Are his methods supernatural?

1111
01:43:25,246 --> 01:43:29,626
Or cheap parlor tricks to conceal
your true identity, Ra's?

1112
01:43:31,502 --> 01:43:35,965
Surely a man who spends his nights
scrambling over the rooftops of Gotham...

1113
01:43:36,174 --> 01:43:38,176
...wouldn't begrudge me
dual identities.

1114
01:43:39,052 --> 01:43:40,803
I saved your life.

1115
01:43:41,012 --> 01:43:43,473
I warned you about compassion, Bruce.

1116
01:43:46,684 --> 01:43:48,853
Your quarrel is with me.

1117
01:43:49,771 --> 01:43:52,232
You let these people go.

1118
01:43:52,523 --> 01:43:55,777
You are welcome to explain
the situation to them.

1119
01:43:58,071 --> 01:43:59,656
Everyone.

1120
01:44:00,490 --> 01:44:02,325
Everybody?

1121
01:44:04,953 --> 01:44:06,788
I...

1122
01:44:07,288 --> 01:44:11,501
I want to thank you all for coming here
tonight and drinking all of my booze.

1123
01:44:13,628 --> 01:44:15,296
No, really.

1124
01:44:16,381 --> 01:44:19,092
There's a thing about being a Wayne...

1125
01:44:19,300 --> 01:44:22,845
...that you're never short of
a few freeloaders, like yourselves...

1126
01:44:23,054 --> 01:44:26,683
...to fill up your mansion with.
So here's to you people. Thank you.

1127
01:44:26,891 --> 01:44:29,477
- That's enough, Bruce.
- I'm not finished.

1128
01:44:29,852 --> 01:44:31,521
To all of you...

1129
01:44:31,729 --> 01:44:36,067
All of you phonies,
all of you two-faced friends...

1130
01:44:36,276 --> 01:44:41,322
...you sycophantic suck-ups
who smile through your teeth at me...

1131
01:44:41,531 --> 01:44:45,076
...please, leave me in peace.

1132
01:44:45,285 --> 01:44:47,870
Please go.

1133
01:44:48,246 --> 01:44:51,624
Stop smiling, it's not a joke.
Please leave.

1134
01:44:51,833 --> 01:44:54,002
The party's over, get out.

1135
01:44:54,210 --> 01:44:57,422
The apple has fallen very far
from the tree, Mr. Wayne.

1136
01:45:02,302 --> 01:45:04,554
He's turning into a jerk.

1137
01:45:10,894 --> 01:45:12,604
Amusing.

1138
01:45:12,937 --> 01:45:16,357
But pointless.
None of these people have long to live.

1139
01:45:16,566 --> 01:45:20,028
Your antics at the asylum
have forced my hand.

1140
01:45:20,236 --> 01:45:22,363
So Crane was working for you.

1141
01:45:22,572 --> 01:45:26,367
His toxin is derived from the organic
compound found in our blue flowers.

1142
01:45:26,743 --> 01:45:28,745
He was able to weaponize it.

1143
01:45:28,953 --> 01:45:30,914
He's not a member of
the League of Shadows?

1144
01:45:31,122 --> 01:45:35,627
Of course not. He thought our plan
was to hold the city to ransom.

1145
01:45:36,377 --> 01:45:40,882
But really, you are gonna release
Crane's poison on the entire city.

1146
01:45:41,090 --> 01:45:45,094
Then watch Gotham tear itself apart
through fear.

1147
01:45:57,982 --> 01:45:59,859
You're gonna destroy millions of lives.

1148
01:46:00,109 --> 01:46:03,404
Only a cynical man would call
what these people have "lives," Wayne.

1149
01:46:03,613 --> 01:46:05,406
Crime. Despair.

1150
01:46:05,615 --> 01:46:07,659
This is not how man
was supposed to live.

1151
01:46:08,326 --> 01:46:11,454
The League of Shadows has been
a check against human corruption...

1152
01:46:11,663 --> 01:46:13,122
...for thousands of years.

1153
01:46:13,331 --> 01:46:16,876
We sacked Rome.
Loaded trade ships with plague rats.

1154
01:46:17,085 --> 01:46:18,461
Burned London to the ground.

1155
01:46:18,670 --> 01:46:21,464
Every time a civilization reaches
the pinnacle of its decadence...

1156
01:46:21,673 --> 01:46:23,591
...we return to restore the balance.

1157
01:46:23,800 --> 01:46:25,343
Gotham isn't beyond saving.

1158
01:46:26,678 --> 01:46:29,347
Give me more time.
There are good people here.

1159
01:46:29,556 --> 01:46:31,349
You're defending a city so corrupt...

1160
01:46:31,558 --> 01:46:34,686
...we have infiltrated
every level of its infrastructure.

1161
01:46:45,822 --> 01:46:47,156
Time to play.

1162
01:46:51,369 --> 01:46:54,038
When I found you in that jail,
you were lost.

1163
01:46:54,205 --> 01:46:56,291
But I believed in you.

1164
01:46:56,499 --> 01:47:00,211
I took away your fear,
and I showed you a path.

1165
01:47:00,503 --> 01:47:02,714
You were my greatest student.

1166
01:47:03,047 --> 01:47:06,175
It should be you standing by my side,
saving the world.

1167
01:47:07,010 --> 01:47:09,596
I'll be standing where I belong.

1168
01:47:10,263 --> 01:47:13,349
Between you
and the people of Gotham.

1169
01:47:15,059 --> 01:47:17,645
No one can save Gotham.

1170
01:47:21,024 --> 01:47:25,653
When a forest grows too wild,
a purging fire is inevitable and natural.

1171
01:47:26,905 --> 01:47:31,534
Tomorrow the world will watch in horror
as its greatest city destroys itself.

1172
01:47:32,118 --> 01:47:35,330
The movement back to harmony
will be unstoppable this time.

1173
01:47:35,663 --> 01:47:37,832
- You attacked Gotham before?
- Of course.

1174
01:47:38,082 --> 01:47:40,752
Over the ages our weapons
have grown more sophisticated.

1175
01:47:40,919 --> 01:47:43,755
With Gotham we tried a new one.
Economics.

1176
01:47:44,214 --> 01:47:48,885
But we underestimated certain
of Gotham's citizens...

1177
01:47:49,344 --> 01:47:51,512
...such as your parents.

1178
01:47:55,600 --> 01:47:59,062
Gunned down by one of the very people
they were trying to help.

1179
01:47:59,354 --> 01:48:02,106
Create enough hunger
and everyone becomes a criminal.

1180
01:48:02,315 --> 01:48:04,734
Their deaths galvanized the city
into saving itself...

1181
01:48:04,943 --> 01:48:07,612
...and Gotham has limped on
ever since.

1182
01:48:07,820 --> 01:48:09,572
We are back to finish the job.

1183
01:48:10,323 --> 01:48:13,534
And this time no misguided idealists
will get in the way.

1184
01:48:13,743 --> 01:48:17,288
Like your father, you lack the courage
to do all that is necessary.

1185
01:48:17,622 --> 01:48:20,458
If someone stands in the way
of true justice...

1186
01:48:20,667 --> 01:48:24,712
...you simply walk up behind them
and stab them in the heart.

1187
01:48:29,759 --> 01:48:31,886
- I am gonna stop you.
- You never did learn...

1188
01:48:32,095 --> 01:48:34,097
...to mind your surroundings.

1189
01:48:36,307 --> 01:48:38,268
Justice is balance.

1190
01:48:38,476 --> 01:48:40,603
You burned my house
and left me for dead.

1191
01:48:43,314 --> 01:48:45,441
Consider us even.

1192
01:49:01,875 --> 01:49:03,585
No one comes out. Make sure.

1193
01:49:13,511 --> 01:49:14,971
They're all gone?

1194
01:49:15,138 --> 01:49:17,891
- How many from maximum security?
- Every one of them.

1195
01:49:18,057 --> 01:49:19,809
Serial killers, rapists.

1196
01:49:20,059 --> 01:49:22,896
Raise the bridges.
We don't want any getting off the island.

1197
01:49:23,062 --> 01:49:24,480
Yeah, I'll raise the bridges...

1198
01:49:24,689 --> 01:49:28,902
...when I get every available unit out here
to catch the homicidal maniacs...

1199
01:49:29,110 --> 01:49:31,946
...that are running loose out there.
- Come on!

1200
01:49:55,178 --> 01:49:57,931
I hope you're not a member
of the fire brigade.

1201
01:50:03,937 --> 01:50:06,022
Master Wayne! Master Wayne!

1202
01:50:10,568 --> 01:50:14,906
What is the point of all those pushups
if you can't even lift a bloody log?

1203
01:50:53,403 --> 01:50:55,446
What have I done, Alfred?

1204
01:50:56,489 --> 01:50:58,408
Everything my family...

1205
01:50:58,616 --> 01:51:00,493
...my father, built...

1206
01:51:02,912 --> 01:51:06,791
The Wayne legacy is more
than bricks and mortar, sir.

1207
01:51:07,000 --> 01:51:09,210
I wanted to save Gotham.

1208
01:51:10,086 --> 01:51:11,921
I failed.

1209
01:51:13,172 --> 01:51:14,424
Why do we fall, sir?

1210
01:51:17,635 --> 01:51:21,097
So that we can learn
to pick ourselves up.

1211
01:51:23,600 --> 01:51:25,727
You still haven't given up on me?

1212
01:51:27,645 --> 01:51:29,105
Never.

1213
01:51:30,189 --> 01:51:31,482
Down!

1214
01:51:31,691 --> 01:51:34,569
Harassment! I see harassment!

1215
01:51:34,777 --> 01:51:36,821
Maybe you'd like to see
some excessive force?

1216
01:51:37,030 --> 01:51:38,907
Madman with a gun.

1217
01:51:40,116 --> 01:51:43,411
With residents furious at the
unprecedented show of police strength...

1218
01:51:43,620 --> 01:51:46,998
...to round up the inmates...
- We're about to raise these bridges.

1219
01:51:47,207 --> 01:51:50,793
Officer, I am a Gotham City
district attorney. Let me pass.

1220
01:51:58,218 --> 01:52:00,470
- Just shut up!
- Hey, Flass, cool it!

1221
01:52:00,678 --> 01:52:01,930
Hold these people back.

1222
01:52:02,138 --> 01:52:05,099
Hey, Gordon.
Somebody here to see you.

1223
01:52:05,308 --> 01:52:07,685
- What are you doing here?
- Our friend sent me with this.

1224
01:52:07,894 --> 01:52:09,312
It counteracts Crane's toxin.

1225
01:52:09,520 --> 01:52:10,980
Hopefully you won't need it.

1226
01:52:11,189 --> 01:52:14,317
Not unless he's got some way
of getting that crap into the air.

1227
01:52:15,485 --> 01:52:17,904
All right, last one across.

1228
01:52:18,613 --> 01:52:22,492
People, they want this bridge up
in no more than three minutes!

1229
01:52:22,742 --> 01:52:26,079
Better get you off the island before
they raise the bridges. Patrolman!

1230
01:52:26,746 --> 01:52:27,747
Go!

1231
01:52:54,566 --> 01:52:56,359
I can't find my mom.

1232
01:52:56,734 --> 01:52:58,194
Hey!

1233
01:53:06,619 --> 01:53:08,329
What the hell are you doing?

1234
01:53:09,873 --> 01:53:11,416
Gentlemen...

1235
01:53:11,875 --> 01:53:14,377
...time to spread the word.

1236
01:53:16,129 --> 01:53:17,505
And the word is...

1237
01:53:18,798 --> 01:53:20,508
...panic.

1238
01:53:44,616 --> 01:53:46,200
Jesus. The pressure, it's spiking.

1239
01:53:47,243 --> 01:53:48,536
Right there.

1240
01:53:48,870 --> 01:53:51,080
That water main
is right under the Narrows.

1241
01:54:08,056 --> 01:54:09,599
It's okay.

1242
01:54:42,465 --> 01:54:43,967
This is Commissioner Loeb.

1243
01:54:44,175 --> 01:54:45,843
Come on, somebody talk to me.

1244
01:54:46,052 --> 01:54:47,470
Come on!

1245
01:55:07,198 --> 01:55:09,200
Loeb, Loeb. This is Gordon.

1246
01:55:09,534 --> 01:55:10,827
What the hell is going on?

1247
01:55:11,035 --> 01:55:14,455
We need reinforcements.
TAC teams, SWAT, riot cops!

1248
01:55:14,664 --> 01:55:18,835
Gordon! All the city's riot police
are on the island with you!

1249
01:55:19,043 --> 01:55:21,045
Well, they're completely incapacitated!

1250
01:55:21,379 --> 01:55:25,341
It's okay, it's okay.
No one's gonna hurt you.

1251
01:55:26,217 --> 01:55:27,844
Of course they are!

1252
01:55:28,052 --> 01:55:31,014
- Crane?
- No. Scarecrow.

1253
01:55:32,807 --> 01:55:34,183
Gordon...

1254
01:55:34,392 --> 01:55:36,603
...there's nobody left to send in.

1255
01:55:38,187 --> 01:55:39,856
So I'm on my own?

1256
01:55:43,985 --> 01:55:45,612
The Narrows is tearing itself to pieces.

1257
01:55:45,820 --> 01:55:48,364
This is just the beginning.
If they hit the whole city...

1258
01:55:48,573 --> 01:55:51,284
...there's nothing to stop Gotham
tearing itself apart.

1259
01:55:51,492 --> 01:55:53,369
- How are they gonna do that?
- The train.

1260
01:55:53,578 --> 01:55:57,373
The monorail follows the water mains to
the central hub beneath Wayne Tower.

1261
01:55:57,582 --> 01:55:59,250
If the machine gets to the station...

1262
01:55:59,459 --> 01:56:02,921
...it'll cause a chain reaction
that'll vaporize the city's water supply.

1263
01:56:03,129 --> 01:56:04,672
Covering Gotham in this poison.

1264
01:56:04,881 --> 01:56:08,051
I'm gonna stop him from loading
that train, but I may need your help.

1265
01:56:08,259 --> 01:56:10,011
- What do you need?
- Can you drive stick?

1266
01:56:16,309 --> 01:56:17,936
There you are!

1267
01:56:18,144 --> 01:56:20,104
There is nothing to fear...

1268
01:56:20,313 --> 01:56:22,023
...but fear itself!

1269
01:56:23,107 --> 01:56:25,401
I am here to help!

1270
01:56:56,641 --> 01:56:58,768
Batman will save us. He'll come.

1271
01:57:04,023 --> 01:57:05,900
- He'll come.
- Don't peek.

1272
01:57:14,576 --> 01:57:17,912
This is Gordon.
Prepare to lower the bridge.

1273
01:57:23,835 --> 01:57:25,920
I told you he'd come.

1274
01:57:30,967 --> 01:57:32,552
Wait.

1275
01:57:33,553 --> 01:57:35,138
You could die.

1276
01:57:35,346 --> 01:57:36,598
At least tell me your name.

1277
01:57:42,020 --> 01:57:44,188
It's not who I am underneath...

1278
01:57:45,189 --> 01:57:49,485
...but what I do that defines me.

1279
01:57:49,861 --> 01:57:51,154
Bruce?

1280
01:58:24,896 --> 01:58:28,191
Well, well. You took my advice
about theatricality a bit literally.

1281
01:58:28,399 --> 01:58:30,860
- It ends here.
- For you and the police, maybe.

1282
01:58:31,069 --> 01:58:33,363
My fight, however,
lies with the rest of Gotham.

1283
01:58:33,571 --> 01:58:36,866
Now, if you'll excuse me,
I have a city to destroy.

1284
01:58:37,075 --> 01:58:40,745
- I can't beat two of your pawns?
- As you wish.

1285
01:58:53,591 --> 01:58:55,885
GPS online.

1286
01:59:02,767 --> 01:59:04,936
In 100 yards.

1287
01:59:35,842 --> 01:59:37,093
Gentlemen.

1288
02:00:04,537 --> 02:00:06,748
Who the hell authorized this?

1289
02:00:17,342 --> 02:00:19,385
Distance to Wayne Tower, three miles.

1290
02:00:26,684 --> 02:00:29,270
The pressure's moving along the mains,
blowing the pipes.

1291
02:00:29,479 --> 02:00:30,813
If that pressure reaches us...

1292
02:00:31,022 --> 02:00:33,983
...the water supply right across
the whole city is gonna blow!

1293
02:00:44,494 --> 02:00:47,330
At the next intersection, turn right.

1294
02:01:12,063 --> 02:01:13,523
You will never learn.

1295
02:01:21,072 --> 02:01:22,073
Sorry.

1296
02:01:26,077 --> 02:01:29,038
- Familiar. Don't you have anything new?
- How about this?!

1297
02:01:45,847 --> 02:01:48,099
You have arrived at Wayne Tower.

1298
02:02:01,446 --> 02:02:02,655
Evacuate the building.

1299
02:02:02,906 --> 02:02:05,366
We're on top of the main hub
and it's gonna blow.

1300
02:02:14,292 --> 02:02:16,461
Weapons system activated.

1301
02:02:20,590 --> 02:02:21,591
Nice ride.

1302
02:02:36,856 --> 02:02:37,857
Armed.

1303
02:02:49,827 --> 02:02:51,287
Don't be afraid, Bruce.

1304
02:02:54,082 --> 02:02:55,458
Come on. Come on.

1305
02:03:00,213 --> 02:03:02,257
You are just an ordinary man in a cape.

1306
02:03:02,465 --> 02:03:06,302
That's why you couldn't fight injustice,
that's why you can't stop this train.

1307
02:03:06,511 --> 02:03:09,055
Who said anything about stopping it?

1308
02:03:14,894 --> 02:03:16,396
Yes!

1309
02:03:24,612 --> 02:03:27,991
You never learned
to mind your surroundings!

1310
02:03:35,874 --> 02:03:38,334
Have you finally learned to do
what is necessary?

1311
02:03:38,668 --> 02:03:40,920
I won't kill you...

1312
02:03:45,383 --> 02:03:47,510
...but I don't have to save you.

1313
02:05:02,710 --> 02:05:05,755
- The meeting's already started.
- What meeting?

1314
02:05:10,051 --> 02:05:12,929
Fox, I seem to remember firing you.

1315
02:05:13,471 --> 02:05:15,014
You did.

1316
02:05:15,223 --> 02:05:17,267
I got another job.

1317
02:05:18,142 --> 02:05:19,602
Yours.

1318
02:05:20,061 --> 02:05:21,729
On whose authority?

1319
02:05:22,397 --> 02:05:24,274
Batman may have made
the front page...

1320
02:05:24,524 --> 02:05:27,402
...but Bruce Wayne
got pushed to page eight.

1321
02:05:34,242 --> 02:05:35,243
Bruce Wayne.

1322
02:05:35,451 --> 02:05:39,205
What makes you think you can decide
who's running Wayne Enterprises?

1323
02:05:39,414 --> 02:05:42,125
- The fact that I'm the owner.
- What are you talking about?

1324
02:05:42,417 --> 02:05:44,294
The company went public a week ago.

1325
02:05:44,502 --> 02:05:45,962
And I bought most of the shares.

1326
02:05:46,337 --> 02:05:49,757
Through various charitable foundations
and trusts and so forth.

1327
02:05:49,966 --> 02:05:53,136
Look, it's all a bit technical,
but the important thing...

1328
02:05:53,386 --> 02:05:56,639
...is that my company's future
is secure.

1329
02:05:57,056 --> 02:05:58,433
Right, Mr. Fox?

1330
02:05:58,641 --> 02:06:00,435
Right you are, Mr. Wayne.

1331
02:06:02,687 --> 02:06:04,230
Didn't you get the memo?

1332
02:06:23,208 --> 02:06:26,377
- I'm sorry I didn't tell you, Rachel.
- No. No, Bruce...

1333
02:06:26,586 --> 02:06:27,921
...I'm sorry.

1334
02:06:28,838 --> 02:06:31,507
The day that Chill died, I...

1335
02:06:33,384 --> 02:06:34,969
I said terrible things.

1336
02:06:35,511 --> 02:06:37,222
But true things.

1337
02:06:37,889 --> 02:06:39,682
I was a coward with a gun...

1338
02:06:39,891 --> 02:06:43,645
...and justice is about more
than revenge, so thank you.

1339
02:06:44,729 --> 02:06:47,398
I never stopped thinking about you.

1340
02:06:48,900 --> 02:06:50,485
About us.

1341
02:06:51,152 --> 02:06:53,071
And when I heard you were back, I...

1342
02:06:53,947 --> 02:06:56,115
I started to hope.

1343
02:07:20,223 --> 02:07:22,892
But then I found out about your mask.

1344
02:07:24,102 --> 02:07:26,896
Batman's just a symbol, Rachel.

1345
02:07:27,564 --> 02:07:29,190
No. This...

1346
02:07:30,400 --> 02:07:32,068
...is your mask.

1347
02:07:34,070 --> 02:07:37,574
Your real face is the one
that criminals now fear.

1348
02:07:38,449 --> 02:07:40,410
The man I loved...

1349
02:07:41,160 --> 02:07:42,579
...the man who vanished...

1350
02:07:43,830 --> 02:07:45,957
...he never came back at all.

1351
02:07:50,461 --> 02:07:53,131
But maybe he's still
out there somewhere.

1352
02:07:55,300 --> 02:07:58,970
Maybe someday,
when Gotham no longer needs Batman...

1353
02:08:00,054 --> 02:08:01,973
...I'll see him again.

1354
02:08:13,067 --> 02:08:15,945
- Proved me wrong, you know.
- About what?

1355
02:08:18,823 --> 02:08:21,242
Your father would be
very proud of you.

1356
02:08:21,492 --> 02:08:23,077
Just like me.

1357
02:08:50,104 --> 02:08:51,940
What will you do?

1358
02:08:53,358 --> 02:08:54,901
Rebuild it.

1359
02:08:55,818 --> 02:08:58,154
Just the way it was, brick for brick.

1360
02:09:05,036 --> 02:09:06,246
Just the way it was, sir?

1361
02:09:08,373 --> 02:09:09,582
Yeah, why?

1362
02:09:09,791 --> 02:09:12,585
I thought this might be
a good opportunity for...

1363
02:09:12,794 --> 02:09:15,213
...improving the foundations.

1364
02:09:15,421 --> 02:09:18,341
- In the southeast corner?
- Precisely, sir.

1365
02:09:34,065 --> 02:09:36,901
- Nice.
- I couldn't find any mob bosses.

1366
02:09:37,902 --> 02:09:40,572
- Well, sergeant?
- It's "lieutenant" now.

1367
02:09:40,947 --> 02:09:42,407
You really started something.

1368
02:09:42,615 --> 02:09:44,576
Bent cops running scared.

1369
02:09:44,784 --> 02:09:46,160
Hope on the streets.

1370
02:09:46,452 --> 02:09:50,039
- But?
- The Narrows is lost.

1371
02:09:50,582 --> 02:09:54,419
And we still haven't picked up Crane or
half the inmates of Arkham that he freed.

1372
02:09:55,128 --> 02:09:56,713
We will.

1373
02:09:56,963 --> 02:09:58,590
We can bring Gotham back.

1374
02:09:58,798 --> 02:10:01,259
- What about escalation?
- Escalation?

1375
02:10:01,467 --> 02:10:05,763
We start carrying semiautomatics,
they buy automatics.

1376
02:10:05,972 --> 02:10:10,268
We start wearing Kevlar,
they buy armor-piercing rounds.

1377
02:10:10,476 --> 02:10:13,730
- And?
- And you're wearing a mask...

1378
02:10:14,188 --> 02:10:16,024
...and jumping off rooftops.

1379
02:10:17,483 --> 02:10:19,485
Now, take this guy.

1380
02:10:19,777 --> 02:10:21,779
Armed robbery, double homicide.

1381
02:10:21,988 --> 02:10:25,200
Got a taste for the theatrical, like you.

1382
02:10:25,491 --> 02:10:27,410
Leaves a calling card.

1383
02:10:33,333 --> 02:10:35,126
I'll look into it.

1384
02:10:38,630 --> 02:10:40,089
I never said thank you.

1385
02:10:45,178 --> 02:10:47,222
And you'll never have to.
