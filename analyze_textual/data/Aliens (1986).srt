How are we today?
Ohh. Terrible.

Well, better than

Where am I?
You're safe.

You're at Gateway Station.
Been here a couple of days.

You were pretty groggy at first,
but now you're okay.

How are you?
Where have you been?

Guess you two
have met, huh?
I'm Burke. Carter Burke.

I work for the company,
but don't let that fool you.
I'm really an okay guy.

20
00:06:18,545 --> 00:06:20,463
I'm glad to see you're
feeling a little better.

21

They tell me that all
the weakness and disorientation
should pass soon.

22
00:06:24,217 --> 00:06:30,097
That's just natural side effects
of such an unusually long hypersleep,
or something like that.

That's the thing.
You were out there
for 57 years.

What happened was
you had drifted
right through the core systems.

And it's really
just blind luck...

found you when they did.

Now, how many different ways
do you want me to tell
the same story?

Now, you freely admit to
detonating the engines of,

and thereby destroying,
an M-class starsreighter,

100
00:11:21,097 --> 00:11:23,557
a rather expensive piece
of hardware.

in adjusted dollars.

That's minus payload,
of course.

corroborates some elements
of your account,

the Nostromo set down
on LV-426,

an unsurveyed planet at that time,
that it resumed its course...

106
00:11:43,995 --> 00:11:48,916
and was subsequently
set for self-destruct
by you for reasons unknown.

Not for reasons unknown.
I told you.

108
00:11:51,461 --> 00:11:57,174
We set down there
on company orders to get this thing,
which destroyed my crew...

The analysis team,
which went over the lifeboat
centimeter by centimeter,

found no physical evidence
of the creature you describe.

Good!
That's because I blew it
out of the goddamn air lock,

113
00:12:12,482 --> 00:12:14,566
like I said.

114
00:12:16,319 --> 00:12:20,906
Are there any species
like this hostile organism
on LV-426?

115
00:12:20,990 --> 00:12:23,492
No. It's a rock.
No indigenous life.

Did I.Q.'s just drop sharply
while I was away?

117
00:12:29,165 --> 00:12:31,542
Ma'am, I already said
it was not indigenous.

118
00:12:31,626 --> 00:12:34,378
It was a derelict spacecraft.
It was an alien ship.

119
00:12:34,462 --> 00:12:39,049
It was not from there.
Do you get it?
We homed in on its beacon.

never recorded once...

- "A creature that gestates
inside a living human host."
- Yes.

"And has concentrated acid
for blood."

That's right.

00:12:56,818 --> 00:13:00,737
Look. I can see
where this is going,

126
00:13:00,822 --> 00:13:03,240
but I'm telling you
that those things exist.

127
00:13:03,366 --> 00:13:06,535
- Thank you, Officer Ripley.
That will be all.
- Please. You're not listening to me.

Kane, the crew member-

129
00:13:09,205 --> 00:13:12,916
Kane, who went into that ship,
said he saw
thousands of eggs there.

130
00:13:13,042 --> 00:13:15,085
Thousands.
Thank you.
That will be all.

Goddamn it,
that's not all!

132
00:13:17,297 --> 00:13:21,008
Because if one of those things
gets down here,
then that will be all!

133
00:13:21,092 --> 00:13:23,635
Then all of this-
this bullshit that you think
is so important-

134
00:13:23,720 --> 00:13:27,514
You can just kiss
all of that good-bye!

135
00:13:33,271 --> 00:13:35,606
It is the finding
of this court of inquiry that...

136
00:13:35,690 --> 00:13:37,774
Warrant Officer E. Ripley,

137
00:13:37,859 --> 00:13:40,903
NOC14472,

138
00:13:40,987 --> 00:13:43,739
has acted with
questionable judgment...

139
00:13:43,823 --> 00:13:48,243
and is unfit to hold
an I.C.C. license
as a commercial flight officer.

140
00:13:49,996 --> 00:13:53,415
Said license is hereby
suspended indefinitely.

141
00:13:55,251 --> 00:13:59,588
Now, no criminal charges
will be filed against you
at this time,

142
00:13:59,672 --> 00:14:01,924
and you are released
on your own recognizance...

for a six-month period
ofpsychometric probation,

to include monthly review
by an I.C.C. psychiatric technician.

145
00:14:12,185 --> 00:14:15,062
These proceedings are closed.

been better.

Look, I think the-

Van Leuwen.

148
00:14:31,788 --> 00:14:35,040
Why don't you
just check out LV-426?

149
00:14:35,124 --> 00:14:38,877
Because I don't have to.
There have been people there
for over 20 years,

150
00:14:39,003 --> 00:14:43,674
and they never complained
about any hostile organism.
What do you mean? What people?

151
00:14:43,758 --> 00:14:46,885
Terraformers.
Planet engineers.

152
00:14:46,970 --> 00:14:50,722
They go in, set up these
big atmosphere processors
to make the air breathable.

153
00:14:50,807 --> 00:14:53,058
Takes decades.

only come at us

I'm trying to figure out
what we're dealing with here.

Let's go through it again.

1079

They grab the colonists,
they move them over there...

1080
01:34:52,437 --> 01:34:56,773
and they immobilize them
to be hosts for more of these.

1081
01:34:56,858 --> 01:35:00,694
Which would mean that
there would have to be
a lot of these parasites, right?

That's over 100, at least.

Yes. Τhat follows.

But each one of these things
comes from an egg, right?

Bees have hives.

01:35:36,064 --> 01:35:40,734

destroyed as soon as
you're finished with them.

1095
01:35:40,818 --> 01:35:43,737

1096

that they were to be kept alive
in stasis for return
to the company labs.

He was very specific
about it.

1098
01:35:53,247 --> 01:35:57,250
Look. Those two specimens
are worth millions
to the bio-weapons division, right?

Now, if you're smart,
we can both come out
of this heroes,

and we will be
set up for life.

You're crazy, Burke.
Do you know that?

1102
01:36:07,720 --> 01:36:11,890
Do you really think you can get
a dangerous organism like that
past I.C.C. quarantine?

1103
01:36:11,974 --> 01:36:14,851
How can they impound it
if they don't
know about it?

1104
01:36:14,936 --> 01:36:17,979
But they will know about it,
Burke, from me.

1105
01:36:18,064 --> 01:36:22,275
Just like they'll know
that you were responsible
for the deaths of 157 colonists.

1106
01:36:22,402 --> 01:36:24,820
Wait a second.
You sent them
to that ship.

1107
01:36:24,946 --> 01:36:27,030
You're wrong.
I just checked
the colony log.

signed Burke, Carter J.

1109
01:36:31,077 --> 01:36:33,995
You sent them out there,
and you didn't even warn them.

1110
01:36:34,122 --> 01:36:36,540
Why didn't you
warn them, Burke?
Okay, look.

1111
01:36:36,624 --> 01:36:39,126
What if that ship
didn't even exist?
Do you ever think about that?

1112
01:36:39,210 --> 01:36:42,879
I didn't know. So now
if I went and made a major
security situation out of it,

1113
01:36:43,005 --> 01:36:46,383
everybody steps in,
administration steps in, and
there's no exclusive rights for anybody.

1114
01:36:46,467 --> 01:36:50,512
Nobody wins.
So I made a decision,
and it was wrong.

It was a bad call, Ripley.
It was a bad call.

Right.
